\fixme{This is merely a copy of the wiki page IaudioBoot, so this section needs
a more natural language and also error checking by Iaudio owners.}

The \playerman{} \playername{} has a builtin boot loader which performs the 
firmware update, and can also access the hard drive via USB. Therefore the 
Rockbox bootloader can be very minimalistic, without USB mode.
This also makes it less dangerous to install the Rockbox bootloader, as you can
always restore it using the iAudio bootloader.

\note{The current bootloader is not prepared to coexist with the original 
firmware. It replaces the original firmware. Therefore it is only useful to 
developers at this point.}

\subsubsection{Installation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the bootloader binary from 
\url{http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/iaudio/}. Use \fname{x5v\_fw.bin}
file if your \dap{} is a X5V. If it is a X5, use the \fname{x5\_fw.bin} file.
\item Copy it to the \fname{FIRMWARE} directory on your X5.
\item Turn the X5 off, remove the USB cable and insert the charger. The X5 will
automatically upgrade the flash with the Rockbox bootloader.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Restoring the original firmware}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the original X5 firmware from the iAudio web site.
\item Copy it to the \fname{FIRMWARE} directory on your X5
\item Turn the X5 off, remove the USB cable and insert the charger. The X5 will
automatically upgrade the flash with the original firmware.
\end{itemize}
