  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bookmark on Stop}
    Write a bookmark to the disk whenever the stop key is pressed.  If playback is stopped it can be resumed easily at a later time. The \textbf{Resume} function remembers your position in the most recently accessed track regardless of this setting.
  \item \textbf{Load Last Bookmark}
    When this is on, Rockbox automatically returns to the position of the last bookmark within a file when it is played.  If set to Ask, Rockbox will ask the user whether they want to start from the beginning or the bookmark.  When set to no, playback always starts from the beginning and the Bookmark file must be played or \textbf{Load Bookmark} selected from the \textbf{Bookmarks} submenu of the Main Menu while the file is playing.
  \item \textbf{Maintain a list of Recently Used Bookmarks}
    If this option is turned on, Rockbox will store a list of Bookmarks that have been accessed recently.  This is then accessible from the \textbf{Recent Bookmarks} option of the \textbf{Bookmarks} submenu of the Main Menu.
