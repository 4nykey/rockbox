\section{Prerequisites}\label{sec:prerequisites}
\index{Installation!Prerequisites}
Before installing Rockbox you should make sure you meet the prerequisites.
Also you may need some tools for installation. In most cases these will be
already available on your computer but if not you need to get some additional
software.

\begin{description}

\item[ZIP utility.]\index{zip}
  Rockbox is distributed as an archive using the
  \fname{.zip} format. Thus you need a tool to handle that compressed
  format. Usually your computer should have a tool installed that can
  handle the \fname{.zip} file format. Windows XP has built-in support for
  \fname{.zip} files and presents them to you as folders unless you have
  installed a third party program that handles compressed files. For
  other operating systems this may vary. If the \fname{.zip} file format
  is not recognised on your computer you can find a program to handle them
  at \url{http://www.info-zip.org/} or \url{http://sevenzip.sf.net/} which
  can be downloaded and used free of charge.

\item[USB connection.]  To transfer Rockbox to your \dap{} you need to
  connect it to your computer. To proceed you need to know where to access the
  \dap{}. On Windows this means you need to figure out the drive letter
  associated with the device. On Linux you need to know the mount point of
  your \dap{}.

  \opt{ipod}{
    Your \dap{} should enter disk mode automatically when connected to a 
    computer via USB. If your computer does not recognise your \dap{}, you may 
    need to enter the disk mode manually. Disconnect your \dap{} from the 
    computer. Reset the \dap{} by pressing and holding the \ButtonMenu{} and 
    \ButtonSelect{} buttons simultaneously. As soon as the \dap{} resets, press 
    and hold the \ButtonMenu{} and \ButtonPlay{} buttons simultaneously. Your 
    \dap{} should enter disk mode, and you can try reconnecting to the computer. 
  }  
         
  \opt{ipod3g,ipod4g,ipodcolor,ipodmini}{
    \note{\index{Firewire}Firewire detection is not supported in Rockbox at 
    the moment. Please use USB only.} 
  }
    
\item[Text editor.]  As you will see in the following chapters, Rockbox is
  highly configurable. In addition to saving configurations within Rockbox,
  Rockbox also allows you to create customised configuration files. If you
  would like to edit custom configuration files on your computer, you will
  need a text editor like Windows' ``Wordpad''.

\end{description}

\opt{ipod}{
  \note{In addition to the requirements described above, Rockbox only works on 
  Ipods formatted with the FAT32 filesystem (i.e., Ipods initialised by iTunes 
  for Windows). It does not work with the HFS+ filesystem (i.e. Ipods 
  initialised by iTunes for the Mac). More information and instructions for 
  converting an Ipod to FAT32 can be found on the 
  \url{http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/IpodConversionToFAT32} wiki 
  page on the Rockbox web site.  Note that after conversion, you can still use 
  a FAT32 Ipod on a Mac. 
  } 
}

\section{Installing Rockbox}\label{sec:installing_rockbox}
\index{Installation}
\opt{MASCODEC}{
  \subsection{Using the windows installer}
  Using the Windows self installing executable to install Rockbox is the
  easiest method of installing the software on your \dap{}. Simply follow the
  on-screen instructions and select the appropriate drive letter and
  \dap{}-model when prompted. You can use ``Add / Remove Programs'' to
  uninstall the software at a later date.

  \subsection{Manual installation}
  For non{}-Windows users and those wishing to install manually from the
  archive the procedure is still fairly simple.
}

\opt{SWCODEC}{
  \subsection{Introduction}

  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{There are three separate components of Rockbox,
  two of which need to be installed in order to run Rockbox.}

  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{There are two separate components of Rockbox
  that need to be installed in order to run Rockbox.}

  \begin{description}
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{
  \item[The \playerman{} boot loader.]
    The \playerman{} boot loader is the program that tells your \dap{} how to boot
    and load the remaining firmware from disk. It is also responsible for the
    disk mode on your \dap{}.

    This boot loader is stored in special flash memory in your \playerman{}.
    It is already installed on your \dap{}, so it is never necessary to modify
    this in order to install Rockbox.}

  \item[The Rockbox boot loader.] \index{Boot loader}
    \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{The Rockbox boot loader is loaded from disk by
    the \playerman{} boot loader. It is responsible for loading the Rockbox
    firmware and for providing the dual boot function. It directly replaces the
    \playerman{} firmware on the \daps{} disk.}
    \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{
    The boot loader is the program that tells your
    \dap{} how to boot and load other components of Rockbox. This is the
    component of Rockbox that is installed to the flash memory of your
    \playerman.}

  \item[The Rockbox firmware.]
    \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{Unlike the \playerman{} firmware, which runs
    entirely from flash memory, }
    \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{Similar to the \playerman{} firmware, }
    most of the Rockbox code is contained in a
    ``build'' that resides on your \daps{} hard drive. This makes it easy to
    update Rockbox. The build consists of a file named \firmwarefilename{} and a
    directory called \fname{.rockbox}, both of which are located in the root
    directory of your hard drive.

  \end{description}

  \subsection{Installing the firmware}
}

There are three different types of firmware binaries from Rockbox website:
\label{Version}
current version, daily build and CVS build. You need to decide which one
you want to install and get the version for your \dap{}.

\begin{description}

\item[Current Version.] The current version is the latest stable release, free
  of known critical bugs.  The current stable release of Rockbox, version 2.5,
  is available at \url{http://www.rockbox.org/download/}.
  \opt{SWCODEC}{
    \note{The current stable release is available only for Archos jukeboxes.
      There has not yet been a stable release for the \playername{}.  Until
      there is a stable release for \playername{}, use a daily build or CVS
      build.
    }
  }

\item[Daily Build.] The daily build is a development version of Rockbox. It
  contains features and patches developed since last stable version.  It
  may also contain bugs! This daily build is generated automatically every day
  and can be found at \url{http://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml}.

\item[CVS Build (formerly, ``Bleeding Edge Build.'')] CVS stands for
  ``Concurrent Versions System.'' CVS is the system that Rockbox
  developers use to keep track of changes to the Rockbox source code. CVS
  builds are made automatically every time there is a change to the
  Rockbox source. These builds are for people who want to test the code
  that developers just checked in.

\end{description}

\nopt{player}{
  \note{\index{Installation!Fonts}
    Rockbox has a fonts package that is available at
    \url{http://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml}. While the daily builds and CVS
    builds change frequently, the fonts package rarely changes.  Thus, the
    fonts package is not included in the daily builds and CVS builds. (The
    stable release, on the other hand, does not change, so fonts are
    included with the stable release.) When installing Rockbox for the
    first time, you should install the fonts package.
  }
}

Because daily builds and CVS builds are development versions which change
frequently, they may behave differently than described in this manual, or
they may introduce new (and maybe annoying) bugs. If you do not want to get
undefined behaviour from your \dap{} you should really stick to the current
stable release, if there is one for your \dap{}. If you want to help the
project development, you can try development builds and help by reporting
bugs. Just be aware that these are development builds that are  highly
functional, but not perfect!

After downloading the Rockbox package connect your \dap{} to the computer via
USB as described in the manual that came with your \dap{}. Take the file that
you downloaded above, and extract its contents to your \daps{} drive.

Use the ``Extract all'' command of your unzip program to extract the files in
the \fname{.zip} file onto your \dap{}. Note that the entire contents of the
\fname{.zip} file should be extracted directly to the root of your \daps{}
drive. Do not try to create a separate directory or folder on your \dap{} for
the Rockbox files! The \fname{.zip} file already contains the internal
directory structure that Rockbox needs.

\note{
  If the contents of the \fname{.zip} file are extracted correctly, you will
  have a file called \fname{\firmwarefilename} in the main folder of your
  \daps{} drive, and also a folder called \fname{/.rockbox}, which contains a
  number of other folders and system files needed by Rockbox. If you receive a
  ``-1'' error when you start Rockbox, you have not extracted the contents of
  the \fname{.zip} file to the proper location.

}

\section{Enabling Speech Support (optional)}\label{sec:enabling_speech_support}
\index{Speech}\index{Installation!Optional Steps}
If you wish to use speech support you will also need a language file, available
from \wikilink{VoiceFiles}. For the English language, the file is called
\fname{english.voice}. When it has been downloaded, unpack this file and copy
it into the \fname{lang} folder which is inside the \fname{/.rockbox} folder on
your \dap{}. Voice menus are turned on by default. See
\reference{ref:Voiceconfiguration} for details on voice settings.

\section{Running Rockbox}
Remove your \dap{} from the computer's USB port.%
\nopt{ipod}{Unplug any connected power supply and turn the unit off. When
you next turn the unit on, Rockbox should load.}%
\opt{ipod}{Rebooting the Ipod by holding
  \opt{IPOD_4G_PAD}{\ButtonMenu{}+\ButtonSelect{}}%
  \opt{IPOD_3G_PAD}{\ButtonMenu{}+\ButtonPlay{}}
  for a couple of seconds until the \dap{} reboots. Now Rockbox should load.
}%
When you see the Rockbox splash screen, Rockbox is loaded and ready for
use.

\opt{ipod}{
  \note{
    Rockbox starts in the \setting{File Browser}. If you have loaded music onto
    your player using Itunes, you will not be able to see your music because
    Itunes changes your files' names and hides them in directories in the
    \fname{Ipod\_Control} folder. You can view files placed on your \dap{} by
    Itunes by initialising and using Rockbox's database. See
    \reference{ref:database} for more information.
  }
}

\section{Updating Rockbox} Updating Rockbox is easy. Download a Rockbox build.
(The latest release of the Rockbox software will always be available from
\url{http://www.rockbox.org/download/}). Unzip the build to the root directory
of your \dap{} like you did in the installation step before. If your unzip
program asks you whether to overwrite files, choose the ``Yes to all'' option.
The new build will be installed over your current build.

\note{
  Settings are stored on an otherwise-unused sector of your hard disk, not in
  any of the files contained in the Rockbox build. Therefore, generally
  speaking, installing a new build does \emph{not} reset Rockbox to its default
  settings. Be aware, however, that from time to time, a change is made to the
  Rockbox source code that \emph{does} cause settings to be reset to their
  defaults when a Rockbox build is updated. Thus it is recommended to save your
  settings using the \setting{Manage Settings} $\rightarrow$
  \setting{Write .cfg file} function before updating your Rockbox build so that
  you can easily restore the settings if necessary. For additional information
  on how to save, load, and reset Rockbox's settings, see
  \reference{ref:SystemOptions}.
}

\section{Uninstalling Rockbox}\index{Installation!uninstall}

If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software, then
connect the \playerman{} to your computer, and delete the
\fname{\firmwarefilename} file.

\opt{h10,h10_5gb}{
  Next, put the \opt{h10}{\fname{H10\_20GC.mi4}}\opt{h10_5gb}{\fname{H10.mi4}}
  file backed up in the installation phase back into the \fname{System}
  directory on your \playertype{}, replacing the file that is there already. As
  in the installation, it may be necessary to first put your device into UMS
  mode.
}

\optv{ipod}{
  Next, open a command window (Windows) or a terminal window (Mac or Linux).
  Navigate to the folder you created when you downloaded the
  \fname{ipodpatcher} program you used to install the Rockbox boot loader.
  Type the following command:

  \begin{code}
    ipodpatcher -w \emph{N} bootpartition.bin
  \end{code}

  Remember that \emph{N} is the number that you found when you installed
  Rockbox on your \playerman{}.
}

If you wish to clean up your disk, you may also wish to delete the
\fname{.rockbox} folder and its contents. Turn the \playerman{} off.

\opt{h300}{Press and hold the \ButtonRec{} button.}

Turn the \dap{} back on and the original \playerman{} software will load.

\opt{h1xx}{
  \note{
    There's no need to remove the installed boot loader. If you want to remove
    it, simply flash an unpatched \playerman{} firmware. Be aware that doing so
    will also remove the boot loader USB mode. As that mode can come in quite
    handy (especially when having disk errors) it is recommended to keep the
    boot loader. It also gives you the possibility of trying Rockbox anytime
    later by simply installing the distribution files.
  }
}

\opt{h300}{
  \note{
    There's no need to remove the installed boot loader, although you if you
    retain the Rockbox boot loader, you will need to hold the \ButtonRec{}
    button each time you want to start the original firmware. If you want to
    remove it simply flash an unpatched \playerman{} firmware. Be aware that
    doing so will also remove the boot loader USB mode. As that mode can come in
    quite handy (especially when having disk errors), you may wish to keep the
    boot loader. It also gives you the possibility of trying Rockbox anytime
    later by simply installing a new build.
