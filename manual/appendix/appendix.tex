\chapter{User feedback}
\section{Bug reports}
If you experience inappropriate performance from any supported feature,
please file a bug report on our web page. Do not report missing
features as bugs, instead file them as feature requests (see below).

For open bug reports refer to
\url{http://www.rockbox.org/tracker/index.php?type=2}

\subsection{Rules for submitting new bug reports}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Check that the bug hasn't already been reported
\item  Always include the following information in your bug report:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Which exact model Jukebox you have (as printed on the unit)
\item  Which exact ROM firmware version you have
\item  Which exact Rockbox version you are using
(Menu{}-{\textgreater}Info {}-{\textgreater} Version)
\item  A step{}-by{}-step description of what you did and what happened
\item  Whether the problem is repeatable or a one{}-time occurrence
\item  All relevant data regarding the problem, such as playlists, MP3
files etc. (IMPORTANT!) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature requests}
For open feature requests refer to
\url{http://www.rockbox.org/tracker/index.php?type=1}

\subsection{Rules for submitting a new feature request}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that the feature hasn't already been requested. 
  Duplicates are really boring!
\item Check that the feature hasn't already been implemented. 
  Download the latest daily build and/or search the mail list archive.
\item Check that the feature is possible to implement (see \rockref{ref:NODO}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\label{ref:NODO}Features we will not implement}
This is a list of Feature Requests we get repeatedly that we simply
cannot do. View it as the opposite of a TODO!

\opt{player,recorder,recorderv2fm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Record to WAV (uncompressed) or MP3pro format!\\
The recording hardware (the MAS) does not allow us to do this
\item Crossfade between tracks!\\
  Crossfading would require two mp3 decoders, and we only have one. 
  This is not possible.
\item Interfacing with other USB devices (like cameras) or 2 player games over USB\\
  The USB system demands that there is a master that talks to a slave. The 
  Jukebox can only serve as a slave, as most other USB devices such as 
  cameras can. Thus, without a master no communication between the slaves 
  can take place. If that is not enough, we have no ways of actually 
  controlling the communication performed over USB since the USB circuit 
  in the Jukebox is strictly made for disk{}-access and does not allow us 
  to play with it the way we'd need for any good communication to work.
\item Support MP3pro, WMA or other sound format playback!\\
  The mp3{}-decoding hardware can only play MP3. We cannot make it play other 
  sound formats.
\item  Converting OGG $\rightarrow$ MP3 \\
  The mp3{}-decoding hardware cannot decode OGG. It can be reprogrammed, but 
  there is too little memory for OGG and we have no documentation on how to 
  program the MAS' DSP. Doing the conversion with the CPU is impossible, since 
  a 12MHz SH1 is far too slow for this daunting task.
\item Archos Multimedia support!\\
  The Archos Multimedia is a completely different beast. It is an entirely 
  different architecture, different CPU and upgrading the software is done 
  a completely different way. We do not wish to venture into this.  Others 
  may do so. We won't.
\item Multi{}-band (or graphic) equaliser\\
  We cannot access information for that kind of visualisation from the MP3 
  decoding hardware.
\item Support other filesystems than FAT32 (like NTFS or ext2 or whatever)!\\
  No. Rockbox needs to support FAT32 since it can only start off a FAT32 
  partition (since that is the only way the ROM can load it), and adding 
  support for more file systems will just take away valuable ram for 
  unnecessary features. You can partition your Jukebox fine, just make sure 
  the first one is FAT32 and then make the other ones whatever file system 
  you want. Just don't expect Rockbox to understand them.
\item Add scandisk{}-like features!\\
  It would be a very slow operation that would drain the batteries and 
  take a lot of useful ram for something that is much better and faster 
  done when connected to a host computer.
\item CBR recording!\\
  The MP3 encoding hardware does not allow this.
\item Change tempo of a song without changing pitch!\\
  The MP3 decoding hardware does not allow this.
\item Graphic frequency (spectrum analyser!)\\
  We can't access the audio waveform from the MP3 decoder so we can't analyse 
  it. Even if we had access to it, the CPU would probably be too slow to 
  perform the analysis anyway.
\item Cool sound effects!\\
  Adding new sound effects requires reprogramming the MAS chip, and we can't 
  do that. The MAS chip is programmable, but we have no access to the chip 
  documentation.
