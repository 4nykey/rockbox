  \begin{description}
  \item[Browse fonts:]
    Browse the fonts that reside in your \fname{/.rockbox/fonts} directory. 
    Selecting one will activate it. See page \pageref{ref:Loadingfonts} 
    for further details about fonts.
    
  \item[Browse WPS files:]
    Opens the File Browser in the \fname{/.rockbox/wps} directory and displays 
    all \fname{.wps} files. Selecting one will activate it, stop will exit 
    back to the menu.  For further information about the WPS see page 
    \pageref{ref:WPS}. For information about editing a .wps file see 
    page \pageref{ref:ConfiguringtheWPS}.
    
  \item[LCD Settings:]
    This submenu contains settings that relate to the display of the \dap.
    \begin{description}
    \item[Backlight:]
    The amount of time the backlight shines after a key press. If set to 
    ``Off'', the backlight will not light when a button is pressed. If 
    set to ``On'', the backlight will never shut off. If set to a time 
    (1 to 90 seconds), the backlight will stay lit for that amount of time 
    after a button press.
    \item[Backlight on When Plugged:]
    This setting is equivalent to the Backlight setting except it applies when
    the \dap\ is plugged into the charger. 
    \item[Caption Backlight:] 
    This option turns the backlight on for 25 seconds either side of the 
    start of a new track so that the display can be read to see song information.
    \opt{h1xx,ipodnano,ipodcolour,ipodvideo}{
      \item[Backlight fade in:]
      The amount of time that the backlight will take to fade from off to on 
      after a button is pressed. If set to ``Off'' the backlight will turn on 
      immediately, with no fade in. Can also be set to 500ms, 1s or 2s.
      \item[Backlight fade out:]
      Like Backlight fade in, this controls the amount of time that the 
      backlight will take to fade from on to off after a button is pressed. 
      If set to ``Off'' the backlight will turn off immediately, with no fade 
      out. Other valid values: 500ms, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s or 10s.
    }
    \item[First Keypress Enables Backlight Only:]
    With this option enabled the first keypress while the backlight is turned 
    off will only turn the backlight on without having any other effect. When
    disabled the first keypress will \emph{also} perform its appropriate action.
    \item[Brightness:]
      Changes the brightness of your LCD display.
    \item[Contrast:] 
    Changes the contrast of your LCD display. 
    \warn{Setting the contrast too dark or too light can make it hard to 
      find this menu option again!}
    \opt{recorder,recorderv2fm,ondio,h1xx,h300,ipodnano,ipodcolour,ipodvideo}{
      \item[LCD Mode:] 
      This setting lets you invert the whole screen, so now you get a 
      black background and light text and graphics.
    }
    \item[Upside Down:]
    Displays the screen so that the top of the display is nearest the buttons.
    This is sometimes useful when carrying the \dap\ in a pocket for easy 
    access to the headphone socket.
    \item[Line Selector:]
    This option allows you to select whether the line selector is a bar 
    of inverted text (``Bar (inverse)'' option) or a small arrow to the 
    left of the menu text (``Pointer'' option).  The default is 
    ``Bar (inverse)''.
    \opt{h300,ipodcolor,ipodvideo,x5}{
      \item[Clear Backdrop:]
      Rockbox allows you to select bitmap pictures to use as backdrops.  
      These backdrops are set in the File Context Menu. \fixme{reference!}
      This option allows you to clear the backdrops that you set.
    }
    \opt{h300,ipodnano,ipodcolour,ipodvideo}{
    \item[Set Background Colour:] 
      Sets the background colour for the LCD display.
    \item[Set Foreground Colour:] 
      Sets the foreground colour for the LCD display.
    \item[Reset Colours:] 
      Resets the LCD display to Rockbox's default colours.
    }

    \item[Remote-LCD Settings:]
    This submenu contains settings that relate to the display of the \dap.
      \begin{description}
      \item[Backlight:]
        Similar to the main unit backlight this option controls the backlight
        timeout for the remote control. The remote backlight is independent
        from the main unit backlight.
      \item[Backlight on When Plugged:]
        This controls the backlight when the \dap\ is plugged into the charger.
      \item[Caption Backlight:]
        This option turns the backlight on for 25 seconds either side of the 
        start of a new track so that the display can be read to see song 
        information.
      \opt{h1xx,ipodnano,ipodcolour,ipodvideo}{
        \item[First Keypress Enables Backlight Only:]
          This controls what happens when you press a button on your remote 
          while the backlight is turned off.  Like for the main unit, if this 
          setting is set to ``Yes'', the first keypress will light up the 
          remote backlight, but have no other effect.  If set to ``No'', 
          the first keypress will light up the remote backlight 
          \emph{and} engage the function of the key that is pressed.
       \item[Contrast:]
         Changes the contrast of your remote's LCD display. 
         \warn{Setting the contrast too dark or too light can make it hard to 
           find this menu option again!}
       \item[LCD Mode:]
         This setting lets you invert the whole screen, so now you get a 
         black background and light text and graphics.
       \item[Upside Down:]
         Displays the screen so that the top of the display is nearest 
         the buttons.  This is sometimes useful when carrying the \dap\ in a 
         pocket for easy access to the headphone socket.

  \item[Scrolling]
    This feature controls how text will scroll in Rockbox. You can configure 
    the following parameters:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Scroll Speed:]
      Controls how many times per second the scrolling text moves a step.
    \item[Scroll StartDelay:]
      Controls how many milliseconds Rockbox should wait before a new 
      text begins scrolling.
      \opt{recorder,recorderv2fm,ondio,h1xx,h300,ipodnano,ipodcolour,ipodvideo}{
      \item[Scroll Step Size:]
        Controls how many pixels the text scroll should move for each step.
      }
    \item[Bidirectional Scroll Limit:]
      Rockbox has two different scroll methods: always scrolling the text 
      to the left and when the line has ended beginning again at the start, 
      or moving to the left until you can read the end of the line and scroll 
      right until you see the beginning again. Rockbox chooses which method 
      it should use depending of how much it has to scroll left. This setting 
      lets you tell Rockbox where that limit is, expressed in percentage of 
      line length.
    \item[Screen Scrolls Out of View:]
      On lists with long entries that don't fit on the screen using 
      \opt{recorder,recorderv2fm,h1xx,h300}{\ButtonOn+\ButtonRight/
        \ButtonLeft}\opt{ondio}{\fixme{tbd}}
      the complete content will be scrolled right/left. With this option set to
      \setting{Yes} the lines can scroll out of view. Otherwise the entries
      will only scroll as far as they align to the margins.
    \item[Screen Scroll Step Size:]
      Determines how many pixels the text should advance in every click when
      scrolling the screen.
    \item[Paged Scrolling:]
      When enabled scrolling will page up/down instead of changing lines. This
      can be useful on slow displays.

    \item[Status/Scrollbar:]
      Settings related to on screen status display and the scrollbar.
      \begin{description}
      \item[Scroll Bar:] Enables or disables the scroll bar at the left.
      \item[Status Bar:] Enables or disables the status bar at the upper side.
      \opt{RECORDER_PAD}{
       \item[Button Bar:] Enables or disables the button bar prompts for the 
         ``F''-keys at the bottom of the screen.
      }
      \item[Volume Display:] Controls whether the volume is displayed as a 
        graphic or a numeric value on the Status Bar.  If you select a numeric 
        display, volume is displayed in decibels.  
        \fixme{cross-reference to volume setting.}
      \item[Battery Display:] Controls whether the battery charge status is 
        displayed as a graphic or numerical percentage value on the Status Bar.

    \item[Peak Meter:]
      The peak meter can be configured with a number of parameters. 
      (For a description of the peak meter see page \pageref{sec:peakmeter}.)
      \begin{description}
      \item[Peak Release:]
        This determines how fast the bar shrinks when the music becomes 
        softer. Lower values make the peak meter look smoother.
      \item[Peak Hold Time:]
        Specifies the time after which the peak indicator will reset.  
        For example, if you set this value to 5s, the peak indicator displays 
        the loudest volume value that occurred within the last 5 seconds.  
        Larger values are useful if you want to find the peak level of a song, 
        which might be of interest when copying music from the \dap via the 
        analogue output to some other recording device.
      \item[Clip Hold Time:]
        The number of seconds that the clipping indicator will be visible 
        after clipping is detected.
      \item[Performance:]
        In high performance mode, the peak meter is updated as often as 
        possible. This reduces the chance of missing a peak value, making 
        the peak meter more precise. In energy save mode, the peak meter is 
        updated just often enough to look fluid.  This reduces the load on 
        the CPU and thus saves a little bit of energy.  If you crave every 
        second of runtime for your \dap\ or simply use the peak meter as a 
        screen effect, the use of energy save mode is recommended.  If you 
        want to use the peak meter as a measuring instrument you'll want to 
        use high performance mode.  
        \fixme{TODO:  determine which platforms support this feature.}
      \item[Scale:]
        Select whether the peak meter displays linear or logarithmic values. 
        The human ear perceives loudness on a logarithmic scale.  If the 
        Scale setting is set to ``Logarithmic (dB)'' scale, the volume values 
        are scaled logarithmically.  The volume meters of digital audio 
        devices usually are scaled this way.  On the other hand, if you 
        are interested in the power level that is applied to your headphones 
        you should choose ``linear'' display.  This setting cannot be 
        displayed in units like volts or watts because such units depend 
        on your headphones.
      \item[Minimum and maximum range:]
        These two options define the full value range that the peak meter 
        displays. Recommended values for the ``Logarithmic (dB)'' setting 
        are {}-40 dB for minimum and 0 dB for maximum. Recommended values 
        for ``linear'' display are 0 and 100\%. Note that {}-40 dB is 
        approximately 1\% in linear value, but if you change the minimum 
        setting in linear mode slightly and then change to the dB scale, 
        there will be a large change. You can use these values for `zooming' 
        into the peak meter.
      \end{description}
    }
    \item[Default Codepage:]
      A codepage describes the way extended characters that aren't available
      within the ASCII character set are encoded. ID3v1 tags don't have a 
      codepage encoding contained so Rockbox needs to know what encoding has
      been used when generating these tags. This should be ``ISO-8859-1'' but
      to support languages outside Western Europe most applications use
      the setting of your operating system instead. If your operating system
      uses a different codepage and you're getting garbled extended characters
      you should adjust this settings. In most cases sticking to 
      ``ISO-8859-1'' would be sufficient.
