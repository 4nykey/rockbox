This well{}-known game will probably be familiar. The aim of the game is
to complete rows with the given pieces (blocks). Pieces can be rotated
to make them fit into the rows.  Once you complete a row, it gets
cleared, but if the blocks reach the top row then you lose.

The controls for this game (with the Jukebox turned so that the buttons
are to the right of the screen) are:

\begin{table}[h!]
