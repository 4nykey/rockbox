Snake 2 {--} The Snake Strikes Back
\par}

Another version of the Snake game. Move the snake around, and eat the
apples that pop up on the screen. Each time an apple is eaten, the
snake gets longer. The game ends when the snake hits a wall, or runs
into itself. 

The controls are:

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
KEY & ACTION \\\hline
UP/DOWN & (in menu) Set game speed \\\hline
F1 & (in menu) Change starting maze \\\hline
F3 & (in menu) Select game type (A or B) \\\hline
UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT & Steer the snake \\\hline
PLAY & Pause the game \\\hline
STOP & Exit the game \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
In game A, the maze stays the same, in Game B
after an increasing number of apples eaten the maze is replaced by a
new one.
