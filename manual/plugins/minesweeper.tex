The classic game of minesweeper.  Use the UP and DOWN keys to select the
required percentage of mines to set the difficulty then press the MENU
key to begin.

The aim of the game is to uncover all of the squares on the board.  If a
mine is uncovered then the game is over.  If a mine is not uncovered,
then the number of mines adjacent to the current square is revealed. 
The aim is to use the information you are given to work out where the
mines are and avoid them.  When the player is certain that they know
the location of a mine, it can be tagged to avoid accidentally
``stepping'' on it.
