# A script to automatically generate audio clips containing the names of all
# folders in a directory tree for use with the "Talkbox" feature available to
# users of the Rockbox open source firmware for Archos MP3 players and
# recorders as well as several other devices. Talkbox permits the device to
# speak the names of the folders as one navigates the directory structure on
# the device, thus permitting "eyes-free" use for those for whom the usual
# visual navigation is difficult or simply inadvisable.
#
# Audio clips are captured and stored in wave format, then converted into MP3
# format by a third party application (lame). If you execute the script,
# passing it the top level of your music file hierarchy as an argument while
# your device is connected to your PC, then the resulting audio clips will be
# generated and stored in the correct location for use with the Talkbox
# feature. Alternatively, if you mirror your music folder structure from your
# PC to your Archos device, you can just run the script on the PC and then
# update the files on your Archos with your usual synchronization routine.
#
# NOTE: If you don't already have them installed, you may obtain the Festival
# text to speech system and several voices at:
#
# http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html
# http://festvox.org/festival/
#
# The most pleasant freely available Festival voice I know of is the slt_arctic
# voice from HST at http://hts.ics.nitech.ac.jp/

# Known bugs
# - This script generates talk clips for all files, Rockbox only uses talk clips
#   for music files it seems.

# Include voicecommon.sh from the same dir as this script
# Any settings from voicecommon can be overridden if added below the following
# line.
source `dirname $0`'/voicecommon.sh'
