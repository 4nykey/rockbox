This is Rockbox Utility, the graphical installer and housekeeping utility
for Rockbox.

Requirements:
=============
- Qt 4.3.0 or greater
- at least the following folders from Rockbox svn:

  o rbutil/
  o tools/
- libusb (Linux, Mac)

Building:

The resulting binary will be located in the rbutilqt subfolder. If you have
multiple versions of Qt installed make sure to pick the correct one.

==========================
Rockbox Utility is build as all-in-one binary. This means for distribution

You don't need any other files like configuration files, especially 
rbutil.ini which will get included into the binary.
