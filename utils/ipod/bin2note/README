bin2note
--------

bin2note implements the buffer overflow exploit documented here:

http://l4n.clustur.com/index.php/Nano2G_getting_exec


It is used to turn a blob of ARM code into an iPod notes file.  This
ARM code will then be executed on the iPod.

It is known to work on the 2nd generation Nano.


The Makefile contains rules for compiling an ARM assembler file
"test.S" into a notes file "test.htm".  Just put test.S in this
directory and type "make test.htm".
