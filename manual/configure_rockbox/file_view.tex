  \item[Sort Case Sensitive:]
    If this option is set to ``Yes'', all files that start with upper case 
    letters will be listed first, followed by all files that begin with lower 
    case letters.  If this option is set to NO, then case will be ignored when 
    sorting files.
  \item[Sort Directories:]
    This option controls how Rockbox sorts folders.  The default is to sort 
    them alphabetically. ``By date'' sorts them with the oldest folder first. 
    ``By newest date'' sorts them with the newest folder first.
    
  \item[Sort Files:]
    This option controls how Rockbox sorts files.  All of the options for 
    ``Sort Directories'' are available in this option.  In addition, there 
    is a ``By type'' option which sorts files alphabetically by their type 
    (such as .mp3) then alphabetically within each type.
    
  \item[\label{ref:ShowFiles}Show Files:]
    This option controls which files are displayed in the File Browser.

    \item[All:] The File Browser displays all files and directories. 
      Extensions are shown. No files or directories are hidden.
    \item[ID3 Database:] This shows the files based on the Tag Cache
      information, thus disabling the file browser. You can browse the
      database by various Tags and search them. Only information present
      in music file tags are shown. For a detailed description of Tag Cache
      refer to page \pageref{ref:tagcache}.
    \item[Playlists:] The File Browser displays only directories and playlists,
      for simplified navigation.
    \item[Music:] The File Browser displays only folders, \fname{.m3u} files 
      and the supported \emph{audio} file formats.  Extensions are stripped.  
      Files and directories starting with \fname{.} or with the ``hidden'' 
      flag set are hidden.
    \item[Supported:] The File Browser displays all directories and files 
      supported by Rockbox (see page \pageref{ref:Supportedfileformats}).  
      Files and directories starting with \fname{.} or with the ``hidden'' 
      flag set are hidden.

  \item[Follow Playlist:]
    This option determine what directory the File Browser displays first.  
    If Follow Playlist is set to YES, when you enter the File Browser from 
    the WPS, you will find yourself in the same directory as the currently 
    playing file.  If Follow Playlist is set to NO, when you enter the File 
    Browser from the WPS, you will find yourself in the directory you were 
    in when you last left the File Browser.
    
  \item[Show Icons:]
    Rockbox has the ability to display an icon to the left of the file 
    in the File Browser.  For details of these icons, please see page 
    \pageref{ref:Supportedfileformats}.
