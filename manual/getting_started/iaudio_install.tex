\subsection{Installing the bootloader}
  Installing the bootloader is the trickiest part of the installation.
  The Rockbox bootloader allows users to boot into either the Rockbox 
  firmware or the iriver firmware. For legal reasons, we cannot distribute 
  the bootloader. Instead, we have developed a program that will patch the 
  Iriver firmware with the Rockbox bootloader. These instructions will explain 
  how to download and patch the Iriver firmware with the Rockbox bootloader 
  and install it on your jukebox.
