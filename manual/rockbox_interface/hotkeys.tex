    Hotkeys are shortcut keys for use in the \setting{File Browser}
    and \setting{WPS} screens.  To use one, press \ActionWpsHotkey{}
    within the \setting{File Browser} or \setting{WPS} screens.
    The assigned function will launch with reference to the current
    file or directory, if applicable.  Each screen has its own
    assignment.  If there is no assignment for a given screen,
    the hotkey is ignored.
    
    The default assignment for the File Browser hotkey is
    \setting{Off}, but the WPS hotkey defaults to
    \setting{View Playlist}.
    
    The hotkey assignments are changed in the Hotkey menu (see
    \reference{ref:HotkeySettings}) under \setting{General Settings}.
