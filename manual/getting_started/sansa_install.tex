  \emph{always} check out the installation page in the wiki at

The installation of the bootloader is the most critical part of the
installation. Please make sure to read the instructions completely
first before doing any installation step. You \emph{need} to
prepare your \dap{} for dual boot as explained below as you
otherwise \emph{will not} have USB access to your player.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Save a copy of your original firmware onto your computer's hard drive.
  You can obtain a firmware file from \url{http://daniel.haxx.se/sansa/mi4.html},
  another way to obtain the file is to intercept the file during the firmware
  upgrade.
\item Install a version of the mi4code program on your system.
  You can get a windows binary from
  \url{http://daniel.haxx.se/sansa/mi4code.html}.
\item Decrypt the mi4 firmware file with the following command
  \begin{code}
    mi4code decrypt -s SKU_E-PP5022.mi4 OF.bin
  \end{code}
\item Copy the decrypted original firmware file \fname{OF.bin} to the 
  \fname{/SYSTEM} folder on your \dap{}. (This folder might be hidden).
\item Download the Rockbox bootloader from 
  \url{http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/sandisk-sansa/}.
\item Copy the bootloader you just downloaded to the root directory
  of your \dap{}.
\item Safely remove your \dap{} from the computer and then disconnect the
  USB cable. This will reboot the \dap{}, then it will install the Rockbox
  bootloader and reboot again into Rockbox.
\end{enumerate}
