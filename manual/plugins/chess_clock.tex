The chess clock plugin is designed  to
simulate a chess clock, but it can be used
in any kind of game with up to ten players.

\subsubsection{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item First enter the number of players (1{}-10) (press  PLAY to
continue). 
\item Then set the total game time in mm:ss (press PLAY to continue,
STOP to go back). 
\item Then the maximum round time is entered.  For example, this could
be used  to play Scrabble for a maximum of 15 minutes each, with each
round taking no longer than one minute. (press  PLAY to continue). 
\item Done. Player 1 starts in paused mode. So press PLAY to start.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{While playing}
The number of the current player is displayed on the top line. The time
below is the time remaining for that round (and possibly also the total
time left if different). 

Keys are as follows:

for the current player or set the total time for the game.
