This is a puzzle game.  It is actually a rewrite of Star, a game written
by CDK designed for the hp48 calculator.

Rules: Take all of the ``o''s to go to the
next level.  The on key allows you to switch between the filled circle,
which can take ``o''s, and the filled square, which is used as a mobile
wall to allow your filled circle to get to places on the screen it
could not otherwise reach. The block cannot take ``o''s.
