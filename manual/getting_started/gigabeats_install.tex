Installing the bootloader is only needed once. It involves replacing the
existing firmware file on your \dap{} with another version. To be able
to boot the original firmware you must generate your own \fname{nk.bin} file
using the mknkboot utility. Alternatively you can use a pre-built bootloader,
however you must keep in mind that by using the pre-built version you will be
unable to dual-boot your \dap{}.
