In order for the project to run as smoothly as possible, it's best if all
contributors adhere to a few simple conventions:

- Write all code in C. Sometimes assembly is faster, but C is always more
  readable and maintainable.

- Write normal C code. Don't redefine the language. No new types,
  no C++isms or Javaisms. Also, do not use "const".

- Variables and function names should be all lower case.
  Preprocessor symbols should be all uppercase.

- Use the brace placement style of your choice, but indent your code with
  four spaces. Don't use TAB characters, as that will mess up code display in
  CVS, printing, and a zillion other places.

- Use "unix style" line feeds: "LF" only. Do not use "CR+LF".
