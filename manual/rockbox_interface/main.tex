Throughout this manual, the buttons on the \dap{} are labelled according to the
picture above. When a table of button actions says ``Long'' before the button it
means that you should make a long press on that button, in other words, press it
for approximately 1 second. In detail the buttons are described in the following
paragraph.

  \opt{h1xx}{ 
  If you lay the \dap{} on the table with the joystick pointing 
  towards you, and the curved sides at the top, you will find the following 
  if you start from the top-right corner and follow the side of the \dap{} in a
  clockwise direction:
  On the right side the buttons \ButtonOn{}, \ButtonOff{}, \ButtonMode{} and
  the \ButtonHold{} switch. Next comes on the bottom the USB port,
  a small hole for resetting the \dap{}, charger plug. On the left side located
  is the button \ButtonRec{}. At least the top has headphone mini-jack plug,
  remote port, optical/line in and optical/line out.
  The joystick in the middle of the \dap{} is 
  used to navigate menus by pressing it up, down, left and right. Pressing the 
  joystick down is labelled \ButtonSelect{} throughout this manual. Its
  directions are labelled \ButtonRight{}, \ButtonDown{}, \ButtonLeft{} and
  \ButtonUp{}.
  
  The internal microphone is located on the left hand side of the nit towards the
  top, and there is a small reset hole on the bottom of the unit between the 
  power and USB sockets.  To perform a hard reset, insert a paperclip into this
  hole.}
  % 
  \opt{h300}{
  Hold or lay the \dap{} so that the side with the button pad and
  LCD is facing towards you.  The buttons on the button pad are as follows:  top 
  left corner: \ButtonOn{}, bottom left corner: \ButtonOff{}, top right corner: 
  \ButtonRec, bottom right corner: \ButtonMode{}.  In the center of the button pad 
  is a button labelled \ButtonSelect{}.  Surrounding the \ButtonSelect{} button are
  four directional buttons used to navigate up, down, left and right.
  
  On the top panel of the \dap{}, from left to right, you can find the 
  following: headphone mini jack plug, remote port, Line-in, Line-out. 
  
  On the bottom panel of the \dap{}, from left to right, you can find the 
  following:  power jack and two USB ports.  The USB port on the right is used 
  to connect your \dap{} to your computer.  The USB port on the left is not 
  used in Rockbox.

  \opt{ipod4g,ipod3g,ipodcolor,ipodvideo,ipodmini}
  { 
  The main controls on the \dap{} are a slightly indented scroll wheel 
  with a flat round button in the center. Hold the \dap{} with these controls 
  facing you. 

  The top of the player will have the following, from left to 
  right:
  \opt{ipod4g, ipod3g ,ipodcolor}{remote connector, headphone jack, \ButtonHold{} 
    switch.}
  \opt{ipodvideo}{\ButtonHold{} switch, headphone jack.}
  \opt{ipodmini}{\ButtonHold{} switch, remote connector, headphone jack.}	

  The dock connector that is used to connect your \dap{} to your computer is on 
  the bottom panel of the \dap{}.

  The button in the middle of the wheel is called \ButtonSelect{}. You can
  operate the wheel by pressing the top, bottom, left or right sections,
  or by sliding your finger around it.  The top is \ButtonMenu{}, the bottom is
  \ButtonPlay{}, the left is \ButtonLeft{}, and the right is \ButtonRight{}.
  When the manual says to \ButtonScrollFwd{}, it means to slide your finger
  clockwise around the wheel. \ButtonScrollBack{} means to slide your finger
  counterclockwise. Note that the wheel is sensitive, so you will need to move
  slowly at first and get a feel for how it works.
  
  Note that when the \ButtonHold{} switch is pushed toward the center of the \dap{}, 
  hold is on, and none of the other controls do anything.  Be sure
  \ButtonHold{} is off before trying to use your player.

  \opt{ondio}{
  The main characteristic of the Ondio case is the dent on its lower right side
  which is the MMC slot. Holding the \dap{} with this slot in the described position
  you'll find the following:

  On the curved top it has the headphone jack to the left,
  the \ButtonOff{} button is in the middle%
  \opt{HAVE_RECORDING}{ and the line in jack to the right}.
  Apart from the already mentioned MMC slot you will find the USB connector on
  the \daps{} right side. Placed on the upper side of the device right below
  the flat display there is the main button pad of the \dap{}. A strong deepening
  marks the center of it and helps to operate the directional keys from there.
  \ButtonLeft{} and \ButtonRight{} form some sort of a strip and divide \ButtonUp{}
  and \ButtonDown{}. The raised button positioned in the lower left of this round
  crosspad is labelled \ButtonMenu{}.}

  Hold the \dap{} with the screen on top and the controls on the right hand side.  
  Below the screen is a cross-shaped touch sensitive pad which contains the 
  \ButtonUp{}, \ButtonDown{}, \ButtonLeft{} and \ButtonRight{} controls.  On the
  top of the unit from left to right are the power socket, the \ButtonHold{} 
  switch, and the headphone socket.  The \ButtonHold{} switch puts the \dap{} into
  hold mode when it is switched to the right 
  of the unit. The buttons will have no effect when this is the case.  
  
  Starting from the left hand side on the bottom of the unit, nearer to the front
  than the back, is a recessed switch which 
  controls whether the battery is on or off.  When this swtich is to the lwft,
  the battery is disconnected.  This can be used for a hard reset of the unit,
  or if the \dap{} is being placed in storage.  Next to that is a connector for
  the docking station and finally on the right hand side of the bottom of the
  unit is a mini USB socket for connecting directly to USB.
  
  Finally on the right hand side of the unit are some control buttons.  Going from
  the bottom of the unit to the top there is a small round \ButtonA{} buttton then a
  rocker volume switch with of the \ButtonVolDown{} button below the \ButtonVolUp{}
  button.  Above that is are two more small round buttons, the \ButtonMenu{} 
  button and nearest to the top of the unit the \ButtonPower{} button, which is held
  down to turn the \dap{} on or off.}
  %
  \opt{x5,m5}{
  The \dap{} is curved so that the end with the screen on it is thicker than the 
  other end.  Hold the \dap{} wih the thick end towards the top and the screen
  facing towards you.  Half way up the front of the unit on the right hand side
  is a four way joystick which is the \ButtonUp{}, \ButtonDown{}, 
  \ButtonLeft{}, and \ButtonRight{} buttons. When pressed it serves as \ButtonSelect.
  
  On the right hand side of the \dap{} from top to bottom, first there is a two 
  way switch.  the \ButtonPower{} button is activated by pushing this switch up,
  and pushing this switch down until it clicks slightly will activate the 
  \ButtonHold{} button.  When the switch is in this position, none of the other
  keys will have an effect.
  
  Below the switch is a lozenge shaped button which is the \ButtonRec{} 
  button, and below that the final button on this side of the unit, the 
  \ButtonPlay{} button.  Just below this is a small hole which is difficult to
  locate by touch which is the internal microphone.  At the very bottom of 
  this side of the unit is the reset hole, which can be used to perform a hard
  reset by inserting a paper clip.
  
  On the bottom of the unit is the connector for the 
  \playerman{} subpack or dock.  On the top of the unit is a charge 
  indicator light, which may feel a bit like a button, but isn't.
  
  From the top of the \dap{} on the left hand side is the headphone socket, then the 
  remote connector.  Below this is a cover which protects the \opt{x5}{USB host
  connector.}\opt{m5}{USB and charging connector}.}

  Hold the \dap{} with the turning wheel at the front and bottom.  On the bottom left
  of the front of the \dap{} is a raised round button, the \ButtonPower{} button.
  Above and to the left of this, on the outside of the turning wheel are four 
  buttons.  These are the \ButtonUp{}, \ButtonDown{}, \ButtonLeft{} and 
  \ButtonRight{} buttons.  Inside the wheel is the \ButtonSelect{} button.  Turning
  the wheel to the right activates the \ButtonScrollDown{} function, and to the
  left, the \ButtonScrollUp{} function.  
  
  On the right of the unit is a slot for inserting flash cards.  On the bottom is 
  the connector for the USB cable.  On the left is the \ButtonRec{} button, and
  on the top, there is the headphone socket to the right, and the \ButtonHold{}
  switch.  Moving this switch to the right activates hold mode in which none of the
  other buttons have any effect.  Just to the left of the \ButtonHold{} switch is a
  small hole which contains the internal microphone.}

  \subsection{Starting the original firmware}
  \label{ref:Dualboot}
  \opt{ipod}
    {
    Rockbox has a dual-boot feature. To boot into the original firmware, shut
    down the device as described above. Turn on the \ButtonHold{} switch
    immediately after turning the player on. Once Rockbox displays the
    message ``Loading original firmware ...'' you may turn the \ButtonHold{}
    switch off. Rockbox will boot into the original firmware.
    
    \note{The described method of dual-booting works with Rockbox bootloader
    version 2, which was released 16 December 2006. If you have the older
    bootloader, boot the original firmware by pressing \ButtonMenu{}
    immediately after turning on your Ipod.  Do not release the
    \ButtonMenu{} button until you see the ``Loading original firmware...''
    message on the screen.}
    
    Regardless of which method you use to boot to the original firmware, you can
    return to Rockbox by pressing and holding \ButtonMenu{} and \ButtonSelect{}
    simultaneously until the player reboots.
    }

  \opt{h1xx,h300}
    {
    Rockbox has a dual-boot feature. To boot into the original firmware,
    when the \dap{} is turned off, press and hold the \ButtonRec{} button,
    and then press the \ButtonOn{} button.
    }

  \opt{h10,h10_5gb}
    {
    Rockbox has a dual-boot feature. It loads the original firmware from
    the file \fname{/System/OF.mi4}. To boot into the original firmware,
    press and hold the \ButtonLeft{} button while turning on the player.
    \note{The iriver firmware doesn't shut down properly when you turn it off,
    it only goes to sleep. To get back into Rockbox when exiting from the
    iriver firmware, you will need to reset the player by \opt{h10}{inserting a
    pin in the reset hole}\opt{h10_5gb}{taking out battery}.}

    {
    Rockbox has a dual-boot feature. To boot into the original firmware,
    press and hold the \ButtonLeft{} button while turning on the player.
    }
  }

\subsection{The first contact}

After you have first started the \dap{} you'll be presented by the
\setting{Main Menu}. From this menu you can reach every function of Rockbox,
for more information (see \reference{ref:main_menu}). To browse the files
on you \dap{} select \setting{Files} (see \reference{ref:file_browser}), and to
browse in a view that is based on the meta-data\footnote{ID3 Tags, Vorbis
comments, etc.} of your audio files, select \setting{Database} (see
\reference{ref:database}).

\subsection{Basic controls}
When browsing files and moving through menus you usually get a list view
presented. The navigation in these lists are usually the same and should be
pretty intuitive.
In the tree view use \ActionStdNext{} and \ActionStdPrev{} to move around
the selection. Use \ActionStdOk{} to select an item. When browsing the file
system selecting an audio file plays it. The view switches to the ``While
playing screen'', usually abbreviated as ``WPS'' (see \reference{ref:WPS}. The
dynamic playlist gets replaced with the contents of the current folder. This
way you can easily treat folders as playlists. The created dynamic playlist can
be extended or modified while playing. This is also known as
``on-the-fly playlist''.
To go back to the \setting{File Browser} stop the playback with the
\ActionWpsStop{} button or return to the file browser while keeping playback
running using \ActionWpsBrowse{}.
In list views you can go back one step with \ActionTreeParentDirectory.

\subsection{Basic concepts}
\subsubsection{Playlists}
Rockbox is playlist oriented. This means that every time you play an audio file,
a so-called ``dynamic playlist'' is generated, unless you play a saved
playlist. You can modify the dynamic playlist while playing and also save
it to a file. If you don't want to use playlists you can simply play your
files folder based.
Playlists are covered in detail in \reference{ref:working_with_playlists}.

\subsubsection{Menu}
From the menu you can customise Rockbox. Rockbox itself is very customisable.
Also there are some special menus for quick access to frequently used
functions.

\subsubsection{Context Menu}
Some views, especially the file browser and the WPS have a context menu.
From the file browser this can be accessed with \ActionStdContext{}.
The contents of the context menu vary, depending on the situation it gets
called. The context menu itself presents you with some operations you can
perform with the currently highlighted file. In the file browser this is
the file (or folder) that is highlighted by the cursor. From the WPS this is
the currently playing file. Also there are some actions that don't apply
to the current file but refer to the screen from which the context menu
gets called. One example is the playback menu, which can be called using
the context menu from within the WPS.

\section{Customising Rockbox}
Rockbox' User Interface can be customised using ``Themes''. Themes usually
only affect the visual appearance, but an advanced user can create a theme
that also changes various other settings like file view, LCD settings and
all other settings that can be modified using \fname{.cfg} files. This topic
is discussed in more detail in \reference{ref:manage_settings}.
The Rockbox distribution comes with some themes that should look nice on
your \dap{}. \note{Some of the themes shipped with Rockbox need additional
fonts from the fonts package, so make sure you installed them.
Also, if you downloaded additional themes from the Internet make sure you
have the needed fonts installed as otherwise the theme may get displayed
garbled.}
