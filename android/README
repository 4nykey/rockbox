This folder contains the java parts needed to build an Rockbox as an
application for android.

* Build instructions

Until there's a script which does all the work the procedure is documented here.

First, make sure you have the ANDROID_NDK_PATH environment variable set up,
otherwise configure will fail to find the compiler.

Use this as your build folder, using '../tools/configure' etc.
    $ ../tools/configure
    $ make

After the build finished, you need to copy librockbox.so to libs/armeabi/.
    $ cp librockbox.so libs/armeabi

For the other files (codecs, themes), you execute 'make zip'. Then you copy the
zip to libs/armeabi, using the name libmisc.so. This is needed, since there's no 
way to bundle stuff into apk's and have access to them from native code other
than pretending it was a library.
    $ make zip
    $ cp rockbox.zip lib/armeabi/libmisc.so

rockbox.zip..err, libmisc.so will be unpacked at runtime.

To finish, you can follow this guide [1], or use eclipse. Simply install eclipse
and the android plugins, then import this folder as a new Android project and run it.
See [2] for a guide on how to set up eclipse for android development.
