\subsection{Doom}
\screenshot{plugins/images/ss-doom}{Doom}{}
This is the famous Doom game.

\subsubsection{Getting started}
For the game to run you need \fname{.wad} game files located in
\fname{/games/doom/} on your player. Create the directory and save the
following files there:
\begin{description}
\item[rockdoom.wad] The Rockbox \fname{.wad}, based on \fname{prboom.wad}
from prboom-2.2.6
\item[Your wad files] Copy all Doom wads you wish to play into that directory.
\end{description}
The needed files can be found at
\url{http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginDoom}

To play addon wads create the \fname{addons} directory within doom. 
Place wad files in this directory. Currently doom only supports 10 addons 
in the directory.

A free alternative for Doom 2 is FreeDoom (\url{http://freedoom.sourceforge.net}).
This can be used in place of \fname{doom2.wad}, or it may be used as an addon in 
Doom, by placing it in the \fname{addons} directory.
