\section{\label{ref:main_menu}Introducing the Main Menu}
\screenshot{main_menu/images/ss-main-menu}{The main menu}{}
The \setting{Main Menu} is the screen from which all of the Rockbox functions can be 
accessed. To enter the \setting{Main Menu}, 
  \nopt{ONDIO_PAD}{press the \ActionStdMenu{} button.}%
  \opt{ONDIO_PAD}{hold the \ButtonMenu{} button.}%

All settings are stored on the unit. However, Rockbox does not spin up 
the disk solely for the purpose of saving settings. Instead, Rockbox will
save settings when it spins up the disk the next time, for example when 
refilling the MP3 buffer or navigating through the \setting{File Browser}.
Changes to settings may therefore not be saved unless the \dap{} is shut down
safely (see \reference{ref:Safeshutdown}).

\section{\label{ref:playlistoptions}Playlist}
  This menu allows you to work with playlists. Playlists can be created in 
  three ways. Playing a file in a directory causes all the files in it
  to be placed in a playlist. Playlists can be created manually by
  either using the  \setting{File Menu} (see \reference{ref:Filemenu}) or using
  the \setting{Playlist} menu. Both automatically and manually created
  playlists can be edited using this menu.

\begin{description}
\item[Create Playlist:]
  Rockbox will create a playlist with all tracks in the current directory 
and all sub-directories. The playlist will be created one directory level ``up'' 
from where you currently are.
  
\item[View Current Playlist:]
  Displays the contents of the playlist currently stored in memory.
  
\item[Save Current Playlist:]
  Saves the current dynamic playlist, excluding queued tracks, to the 
specified file. If no path is provided then playlist is saved to current 
directory (see \reference{ref:Playlistsubmenu}).

\item[Playlist Catalog:]
  The \setting{Playlist Catalog} provides a simple interface to maintain
  several playlist (see \reference{label:WorkingWithPlaylists}).
\end{description}

\section{Plugins}
  With this option you can load and run various plugins that have been
written for Rockbox. There are a wide variety of these supplied with
Rockbox, including several games, some impressive demos and a number of
utilities. A detailed description of the different plugins is to be found in 
\reference{ref:plugins}.

\section{\label{ref:Info}System}
  This option shows RAM buffer size, battery voltage level and estimated time
remaining, disk total space and disk free space.
\opt{player}{Use the MINUS and PLUS keys to step through several 
pages of information.}

\begin{description}
\item[Rockbox Info:]
  Displays some basic system information. This is, from top to bottom,
  the amount of memory Rockbox has available for storing music (the buffer).
  The battery status.
\opt{ondio}{%
  Memory size and amount of free space on the two data volumes, this info is
  given seperately for internal memory (\emph{Int}) and for a plugged in MMC
(\emph{MMC}).
}%
\nopt{ondio}{Hard disk size and the amount of free space on the disk.}

\item[Version:]
  Software version and credits display.
  
\item[Sleep Timer:]
  The \setting{Sleep Timer} powers off your \dap{} after playing for a given
  time. It can be set from \setting{Off} to 5 hours in 5 minute steps.
  The \setting{Sleep Timer} is reset on boot.
  \opt{HAVE_RTC_ALARM}{Using this option disables the \setting{Wake up alarm}.}

\item[Debug (Keep Out!):]
  This sub menu is intended to be used \emph{only} by Rockbox developers.
  It shows hardware, disk, battery status and other technical information.  
  \warn{It is not recommended that users access this menu unless instructed to
  do so in the course of fixing a problem with Rockbox. If you think you have 
  messed up your settings by use of this menu please try to reset \emph{all} 
  settings before asking for help.}
\end{description}

\opt{player}{
  \section{Shutdown}
  This menu option saves the Rockbox configuration and turns off the hard
  drive before shutting down the machine. For maximum safety this procedure
  is recommended when turning off the \dap. (There is a very small risk
  of hard disk corruption otherwise.) See \reference{ref:Safeshutdown}
  for more details.

\section{Quick Menu}
  Whilst not strictly part of the \setting{Main Menu}, it is worth noting that
  a few of the more commonly used settings are available from the
  \setting{Quick Menu}.
  The \setting{Quick Menu} screen is accessed with \ActionStdQuickScreen{}
  and exited with the same button.
  It allows rapid access to the \setting{Shuffle} and \setting{Repeat}
  modes (\reference{ref:PlaybackOptions}) and the \setting{Show Files}
  option (\reference{ref:ShowFiles}).
