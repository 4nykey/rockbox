\subsection{Battery}
    Options relating to the batteries in the \dap.
  \begin{description}
    \item [Battery Capacity: ]This setting can be used to tell Rockbox what
      capacity (in mAh) of battery is being used inside it. The default is
      \opt{player,recorder}{1500mAh}%
      \opt{recorderv2fm}{2200mAh}%
      \opt{ondiosp,ondiofm}{1000mAh}%
      \opt{h1xx,h300}{1300mAh}%
      \opt{ipodmini}{400mAh (1G) or 630mAh (2G)}%
      \opt{ipodcolor}{700mAh}%
      \opt{ipodnano,ipodvideo,ipod4g,ipod3g}{\fixme{unknown}}%
      \opt{x5}{950mAh}%
      , which is the capacity value for the standard batteries shipped with the
      \dap. Rockbox uses this value to estimate remaining battery life for the 
      statusbar and WPS. Changing this setting has no effect what-so-ever on 
      actual battery life. This setting only affects the accuracy of the 
      battery life estimation as shown on screen.
   
      \opt{ipod}{This value is fairly meaningless in the iPod family at
        present, and work is on-going into finding a better way to determine 
        battery life.}
    
    \opt{ondiosp,ondiofm}{
    \item [Battery Type: ]This setting tells Rockbox wich type of battery
      that is currently used in the \dap{}. Select \setting{Alkaline} or
      \setting{NiMH} with \ButtonUp/\ButtonDown.
    }

\subsection{Disk}
    Options relating to the hard disk.

  \begin{description}
    \item [Disk Spindown: ]Rockbox has a timer that makes it spin down the
      hard disk after it is idle for a certain amount of time. This setting
      controls the amount of time between the last user activity and the time
      that the disk spins down. This idle time is only affected by user
      activity, like navigating through file browser. When the hard disk spins
      up to fill the audio buffer, it automatically spins down afterwards.
      
    \opt{recorder,h1xx,h300,x5}{
      \item [Disk Poweroff: ]This setting controls whether the disk is powered
      off or only set to ``sleep'' when spun down. If this setting is set to
      \setting{Yes}, the disk will power off. If set to \setting{No}, the disk
      will enter ``sleep'' mode. Power off uses less power but takes slightly
      longer to spin-up.
    }
    \opt{SWCODEC}{
    \item [Directory Cache: ]Rockbox has the ability to scan the contents of
      your drive in the background and save those contents to a cache in RAM.
      The \setting{Directory Cache} takes a small amount of memory away from 
      Rockbox that would otherwise be used to buffer music, but it speeds up 
      navigation by eliminating the slight pause between the time a navigation 
      button is pressed and the time Rockbox responds. Turning this setting 
      \setting{On} activates the directory cache, and turning it \setting{Off} 
      deactivates the directory cache.
      \note{The first time you set the directory cache to \setting{On},
      Rockbox will request a reboot of the \dap\ and upon restarting take a few
      minutes to scan the drive. Thereafter, the directory cache will work in the
      background.}
    }

\opt{CONFIG_RTC}{
  \subsection{Time and Date}
  Time related menu options.
    \begin{description}
      \item [Set Time/Date: ]Set current time and date.
      \item [Time Format: ] Choose 12 or 24 Hour clock.
    \end{description}
}

\subsection{Idle Poweroff}
Rockbox can be configured to turn off power after the unit has been idle for a 
defined number of minutes. The \dap{} is idle when playback is stopped or 
paused. It is not idle while the USB or charger is connected, or while 
recording. Settings are either \setting{Off} or \setting{1} to \setting{10}
minutes in 1 minute steps. Then \setting{15,30,45} and \setting{60} minutes are
available.
\subsection{Sleep Timer}
This option lets you power off your \dap{} after playing for a given time. Can
be set from \setting{Off} to 5 hours in 5 minute steps.
\opt{recorderv2fm}{This setting is reset on boot. Using this option
  disables the \setting{Wake up alarm} (see below).}
\opt{recorderv2fm}{
  \subsection{Wake Up alarm}
    This option turns the \dap{} off and then starts it up again at the 
    specified time. This is most useful when combined with the \setting{Resume}
    setting in the \setting{Playback Options} menu is set to \setting{Yes}, so 
    that the \dap{} wakes up and immediately starts playing music. Use 
    \ButtonLeft{} and \ButtonRight{} to adjust the minutes setting, \ButtonUp{}
    and \ButtonDown{} to adjust the HOURS.
    \ButtonPlay{} confirms the alarm and shuts your \dap{} down, and \ButtonOff
    cancels setting an alarm. If the \dap{} is turned on again before the alarm
    occurs, the alarm will be canceled. Using this option disables the 
    \setting{Sleep Timer}(see above).
}

\subsection{Limits}
This submenu relates to limits in the Rockbox operating system.
  \begin{description}
    \item [Max files in dir browser: ]This setting controls the limit on
    the number of files that you can put in any particular directory in the
    file browser. You can configure the size to be between 50 and 10,000 files
    in steps of 50 files. The default is 400. Higher values will shorten the
    music buffer, so you should increase this setting \emph{only} if you have
    directories with a large number of files.

    \item [Max playlist size: ]This setting controls the maximum size of 
    a playlist. The playlist size can be between 1,000 and 20,000 files,
    in steps of 1,000 (default is 10,000). Higher values will shorten the
    music buffer, so you should increase this setting \emph{only} if you
    have very large playlists.
  \end{description}

\opt{player,recorder,recorderv2fm}{
\subsection{Car Adapter Mode}
      This option turns \setting{On} and \setting{Off} the car ignition
      auto stop function.
  \begin{description}
  \item [Car Adapter Mode: ]When using the \dap\ in a car,
  \setting{Car Adapter Mode} automatically stops playback on the \dap\ when
  power (i.e. from cigarette lighter power adapter) to the external DC in jack
  is turned off. If the \setting{Car Adapter Mode} is set to \setting{On},
  Rockbox will pause playback when the external power off condition is
  detected. Rockbox will then shutdown the \dap\ after the length of time set
  in the \setting{Idle Poweroff} setting (see above).
  If power to the DC in jack is turned back on before the \emph{Idle Poweroff}
  function has shut the \dap\ off, playback will be resumed 5 seconds after
  the power is applied. This delay is to allow for the time while the car
  engine is being started.
  \end{description}

  Once the \dap\ is shut off either manually, or automatically with the
  \setting{Idle Poweroff} function, it must be powered up manually to resume
  playback.

\opt{player}{
  \subsection{Line In} This option activates the line in port on \dap, which is
    off by default. This is useful for such applications as:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Game boy $\rightarrow$ \dap $\rightarrow$ human
    \item laptop $\rightarrow$ \dap $\rightarrow$ human
    \item LAN party computer $\rightarrow$ \dap $\rightarrow$ human
    \end{itemize}
