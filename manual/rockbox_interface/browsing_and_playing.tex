\section{\label{ref:file_browser}File Browser}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-file-browser}{The file browser}{}
Rockbox lets you browse your music in either of two ways. The 
\setting{File Browser} lets you navigate through the files and folders on 
your \dap, entering folders and executing the default action on each file.
To help differentiate files, each file format is displayed with an icon. 

The \setting{Database Browser}, on the other hand, allows you to navigate 
through the music on your player using categories like album, artist, genre,
etc.

You can select whether to browse using the \setting{File Browser} or the
\setting{Database Browser} by selecting either \setting{Files} or
\setting{Database} in the \setting{Main Menu}.
If you choose the \setting{File Browser}, the \setting{Show Files} setting
lets you select what types of files you wish to view. See
\reference{ref:ShowFiles} for more information on the \setting{Show Files}
setting.

\note{The \setting{File Browser} allows you to manipulate your files in ways
that are not available within the \setting{Database Browser}. Read more about
\setting{Database} in \reference{ref:database}. The remainder of this section
deals with the \setting{File Browser}.}

\opt{ondio}{
Unlike the Archos Firmware, Rockbox provides multivolume support for the
MultiMediaCard, this means the \dap{} can access both data volumes (internal
memory and the MMC), thus being able to for instance, build playlists with
files from both volumes.
In the \setting{File Browser} a new folder will appear as soon as the device
has read the content after inserting the card. This new folder's name is
generated as \fname{<MMC1>}, and will behave exactly as any other folder
on the \dap{}.
}

\opt{h10,h10_5gb}{\note{
If your \dap{} is a MTP model, the Music folder where all your music is stored
may be hidden in the \setting{File Browser}. This may be fixed by either
either changing it's properties (on a computer) to not hidden, or by changing
the \setting{Show Files} setting to all.

\subsection{\label{ref:Filemenu}\label{ref:PartIISectionFM}File Menu}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-file-menu}{The File Menu}{}

The \setting{File Menu} allows you to perform certain operations on files or 
folders.  To access the \setting{File Menu}, position the selector over a file 
or folder and access the context menu with \ActionStdContext{}.

\note{The \setting{File Menu} is a context sensitive menu.  If the 
\setting{File Menu} is invoked on a file, it will display options available 
for files.  If the \setting{File Menu} is invoked on a folder or directory, 
it will display options for directories.}

The \setting{File Menu} contains the following options (unless otherwise noted, 
each option pertains both to files and directories):

\begin{description}
\item [Playlist.]
  Enters the \setting{Playlist Submenu} (see \reference{ref:playlist_submenu}).
\item [Playlist Catalog.]
  Enters the \setting{Playlist Catalog Submenu} (see 
  \reference{ref:playlist_catalog}).
\item [Rename.]
  This function lets the user modify the name of a file or directory.
\item [Cut.]
  Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard
  and marks it to be `cut'.
\item [Copy.]
  Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard
  and marks it to be `copied'.
\item [Paste.]
  Only visible if a file or directory name is on the clipboard. When selected
  it will move or copy the clipboard to the current directory.
\item [Delete.]
  Deletes the currently selected file. This option applies only to files, and
  not to directories. Rockbox will ask for confirmation before deleting a file.
  Press \ActionYesNoAccept{}
  to confirm deletion or any other key to cancel.
\item [Delete Directory.]
  Deletes the currently selected directory and all of the files and folders
  contained in the selected directory.  Deleted directories cannot be recovered.
  Use this feature with caution!
\item [Open with.]
  Runs a viewer plugin on the file. Normally, when a file is selected in Rockbox,
  Rockbox automatically detects the file type and runs the appropriate plugin.
  The \setting{Open With} function can be used to override the default action and
  select a viewer by hand.
  For example, this function can be used to view a text file
  even if the file has a non-standard extension (i.e., the file has an extension
  of something other than \fname{.txt}). See \reference{ref:Viewersplugins}
  for more details on viewers.
\item [Create Directory.]
  Create a new directory in the current directory on the disk.
\item [Properties.]
  Shows properties such as size and the time and date of the last modification
  for the selected file. If used on a directory, the number of files and sub
  directories in that directory will be shown, as well as the total size.
\item [Set As Recording Directory.]
  Save recordings in the selected directory.

This is the virtual keyboard that is used when entering text in Rockbox, for
  example when renaming a file or creating a new directory.
