Jewels is a simple yet addicting game which involves swapping pairs of jewels in order to form connected segments of three or more of the same type.
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible before running out of available moves. Higher points are awarded to larger combos. The game advances to the next level after every one hundred points and randomly clears several jewels.\\
