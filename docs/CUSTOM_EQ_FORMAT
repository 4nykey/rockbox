Custom EQ
File Format Specifications

Description / General Info
--------------------------
* The Custom EQ is used on both the Rockbox Player and Recorder, in order to
  load, well, custom eq settings.
* After editing the .eq file, you may need to reboot your Rockbox.

File Location

The files may reside anywhere on the hard disk. The only restriction is that
the filename must end in .eq

Format Rules
------------
* Each setting must have it's own line
* The setting you wish to change must be in brackets.
* The value must be immediately after the end bracket, with no spaces.
* There must be a # immediately after the value, with no spaces

* If a value is out of the acceptable range for the device, which can vary 
  depending on the model, a Syntax Error will be displayed and the value
  will be set to the default value.
