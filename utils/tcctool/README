tcctool
-------

tcctool is a utility for uploading code to Telechips TCC77x based
devices in USB boot mode.

It has been tested on the iaudio 7 and Logik DAX DAB/MP3 Player, but
should work on other devices if the appropriate magic value is
identified from existing "firmware recovery" programs - see the
"devices" array in tcctool.c

It can be used for safely testing firmware images before performing a
firmware upgade.

A first test when using tcctool on a new device can be to upload the
original firmware.  If you do this, make sure you upload the same
version that is installed on your player - otherwise you may find
yourself with corrupted config files and music database.
