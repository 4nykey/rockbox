The object of the game is to push boxes into their correct position in a
crowded warehouse with a minimal number of pushes and moves. The boxes
can only be pushed, never pulled, and only one can be pushed at a time.

The controls are:

\begin{table}
\begin{btnmap}{}{}
UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT & Move the ``sokoban'' up, down, left or right \\
F1 & Back to previous level \\
F2 & Restart level \\
F3 & Go to next level \\
ON & Undo last movement \\
OFF & Exit sokoban \\
\end{btnmap}
\end{table}
