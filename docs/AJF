Description of the binary AJF font file format

Index    Descripton

00       MAGIC1 (0xBD)
01       MAGIC2 (0xFC) used to make sure this is an ajf font
02       Unused, planned use: "code page"
03 - 22  ASCII text holding the font name
23 - 24  "bound width"  (high 8 bits, low 8 bits)
25 - 26  "bound height" (high 8 bits, low 8 bits)
26 - 28  first character in the font
29 - 2a  0x00ff (supposed number of characters in the font?)
2b -     map offset table starts here. Each offset entry is supposed to be 
         three bytes: width, offset highbyte, offset lowbyte
         The offset is a relative offset, counted in bytes, to where in the
         font data this particular char's bitmap image starts.

         font data, in Rockbox-internal image-format. That means column-wise
         left-to-right for the full width, the first 8 pixels of height. Then
         follows the next 8 pixels of height left-to-right.

         We don't currently support fonts larger than 16 pixels.
