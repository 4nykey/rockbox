Custom EQ
File Format Specifications

Description / General Info
--------------------------
* The Custom EQ is used on both the Rockbox Player and Recorder, in order to
  load, well, custom eq settings.
* After editing the .eq file, you may need to reboot your Rockbox.

File Location
-------------
The files may reside anywhere on the hard disk. The only restriction is that
the filename must end in .eq

Format Rules
------------
* Each setting must have it's own line
* The setting you wish to change must be in brackets.
* The value must be immediately after the end bracket, with no spaces.
* There must be a # immediately after the value, with no spaces
* Any text after the # will be ignored
* If a value is out of the acceptable range for the device, which can vary 
  depending on the model, a Syntax Error will be displayed and the value
  will be set to the default value.

Example File
------------
[volume]70#(0 to 100)
[bass]11#(-15 to 15 [Range depends on MAS])
[treble]12#(-15 to 15 [Range depends on MAS])
[balance]0#(-100 to 100)

This sets each line to the respective values after it. Notice that you can put comments after the #
