This is the popular snake game. The aim is to grow your snake as large
as possible by eating the dots that appear on the screen. The game will
end when the snake touches either the borders of the screen or itself.

Change levels with UP/DOWN keys (level 1 is slowest, level 9 is
fastest). Press PLAY to start or pause.
