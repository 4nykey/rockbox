This folder contains the java parts needed to build an Rockbox as an
application for android.

* Prerequisites

Download and install the Android SDK[1] and NDK[2].
After you extracted the SDK, you need to run <sdk-dir>/tools/android in order to
install the actual platform sdk from the available packages tab (SDK Platform
Android 1.5 or above should work).
In the virtual devices tab you can also setup a emulator.


Then, make sure you have the ANDROID_SDK_PATH and ANDROID_NDK_PATH (pointing to
the each's root directory) environment variables set up, otherwise configure will fail to find the compiler and
compiling the java files will fail.

* Build instructions

Use this as your build folder, using '../tools/configure' etc.
    $ ../tools/configure # type 200, then chose A for android and your screen resolution
    $ make


After the build finished, build the zip file which contains codecs and themes (the binary is a separate file):
    $ make zip

Once you have the zip, pack it and the binary into the apk
    $ make apk

Side note: You don't necessarily need to recreate the zip once you have it, only if you're unsure or if you know its content changed. 
Not recreating it will save time because it's only unzipped on the device if it's newer than what's on the device

You can install that on your device or emulator with the following command:
    $ $ANDROID_SDK_PATH/tools/adb install -r bin/Rockbox.apk
