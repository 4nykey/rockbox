# This file defines the options for the device configuration panel
# Declare a section with a line containing a string inside brackets, i.e.
# [Some Section]
# Declare options within the section in the following format, one per line
# tag;Tag Label;[input];default
# tag is the skin tag represented by that option
#
# Tag Label is a human-readable label to attach to the input
#
# [input] is the type of widget that should be used for the tag, and its range
# if applicable.  The valid forms are
# check - Inserts a true/false checkbox
# text - Inserts a line edit box
# slider(min, max) - Inserts a horizontal slider with range specified
# spin(min, max) - Inserts a spin box with range specified
# fspin(min, max) - Inserts a floating point spin box with range specified
# combo(option1, option2...) - Inserts a combo box with the options specified
#
# default is the default value for the input
#
# Note that there aren't any provisions for escaping characters at the moment,
# so don't include [, ], or ; in your text, or (, ) in combo box choices
#
# Blank lines are ignored
#
# Be warned: because this file is compiled into the application, I'm not
# performing much of any error checking on it: screwing up the syntax may very
# well segfault the application on startup
