\subsection{Disk Tidy}
  Disk Tidy deletes junk files left behind by Windows, Linux or OS X after a USB
  connection. Select the OS's files you want to delete in the `Files to Clean'
  menu and select `Start Cleaning' to begin to process. The settings
  are stored in \fname{.rockbox/rocks/apps/disktidy.config}, in a plain text
  file that is user-modifiable to allow more entries to be added.
  
  You can use up to one '*' as a wild-card character which matches any string.
  the first '*' is recognized as a wild-card character and any additional '*' are 
  literal '*'.
  
  \warn{Be careful when you use custom entries.
  You could accidentally delete important files.}
