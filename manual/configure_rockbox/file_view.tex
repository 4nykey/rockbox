	\subsection{File View}
  This menu deals with options relating to how the file browser displays files
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sort Case Sensitive}
    If this option is enabled files that start with a lower case letter will appear after the files that start with an upper case letter have all been listed  If disabled, then case will be ignored when sorting files.
  \item \textbf{Sort Directories}
    This option controls how Rockbox sorts folders.  The default is to sort them alphabetically.  ``By date'' sorts them with the oldest folder first.  ``By newest date'' sorts them with the newest folder first.
    
  \item \textbf{Sort Files}
    This option controls how Rockbox sorts files.  In addition to the options for directory sorting above, there is a ``By type'' option which sorts files alphabetically by their type (such as .mp3) then alphabetically within each type.
    
  \item \textbf{\label{ref:ShowFiles}Show Files}
    Controls which files are displayed in the directory browser:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Music: }
      Only directories, .m3u files and the supported \emph{audio} fileformats are shown. Extensions are strippe'd. Files anddirectories starting with . Or with the ``hidden'' flag set are hidden.
    \item \textbf{Playlists:} 
      Only shows directories and playlists, for simplified navigation.
    \item \textbf{Supported:} 
      All directories and files Rockbox understands (see page \pageref{ref:Supportedfileformats}) are shown. Files and directories starting with . or with the ``hidden'' flag set are hidden.
    \item \textbf{All:}
      All files and directories are shown. Extensions are shown. No files or directories arehidden
    \end{itemize}
    
  \item \textbf{Follow Playlist}
    If Follow Playlist is set to ``Yes'', you will find yourself in the same directory as the currently playing file if you go to the Directory Browser from the WPS. If set to ``No'', you will stay in the same directory as you were last in.
    
  \item \textbf{Show Icons}
    This indicates whether Rockbox will display an icon representing what type a file is on the left of the file in the browser.  For details of these icons, please see page \pageref{ref:Supportedfileformats}.
