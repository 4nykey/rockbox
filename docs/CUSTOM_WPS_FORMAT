Custom WPS Display
File Format Specifications

Description / General Info
--------------------------
* The Custom WPS Display is used on both the Rockbox Player and Recorder, 
  as a means to customize the WPS to the user's likings.
* After editing the .wps file, "play" it to make it take effect.
* The file may be 2 lines long for the Player, and 10 lines for the Recorder.
* All characters not preceded by % are displayed as typed.

File Location
-------------
Custom WPS files may be located anywhere on the drive. The only restriction is
that they must end in .wps. When you PLAY a .wps file, it'll be used for the
future WPS screens. If the "played" wps file is located in the /.rockbox
folder, it'll be remembered and used for subsequent restarts. Filenames in the
/.rockbox folder must be no more than 24 characters long.

Playlist/Song Info Tags:
  %pb : Progress Bar
        Player: This will display a 1 character "cup" that empties as the
                progresses.
        Recorder: This will replace the entire line with a progress bar.
  %pf : Player: Full-line progress bar + time display

        The entire line is used as volume peak meter.

Conditional Tags (If/Else block):
  %?xx<|> : Conditional: if the tag specified by "xx" has a value, the 
            text between the "<" and the "|" is displayed, else the text
            between the "|" and the ">" is displayed. 
            The else part is optional, so the "|" does not have to be
            specified if no else part is desired. The conditionals nest, 
            so the text in the if and else part can contain all % 
            commands, including conditionals.

Other Tags:
  %%  : Display a '%'
  %<  : Display a '<'
  %|  : Display a '|'
  %>  : Display a '>'
  %s  : Indicate that the line should scroll. Can occur anywhere in 
        a line (given that the text is displayed; see conditionals
        above). You can specify up to 10 scrolling lines.
        Scrolling lines can not contain dynamic content such as timers,
        peak meters or progress bars.

Example File
------------
%s%?in<%in - >%?it<%it|%fn> %?ia<[%ia%?id<, %id>]>
%pb%pc/%pt

That is, "tracknum - title [artist, album]", where most fields are only
displayed if available. Could also be rendered as "filename" or
"tracknum - title [artist]".

Default
-------
If you haven't selected a .wps file in the .rockbox directory, you get the
hardcoded wps layout. The default WPS screen is for player:

%s%pp/%pe: %?it<%it|%fn> - %?ia<%ia|%d2> - %?id<%id|%d1>
%pc%?ps<*|/>%pt

and for recorder:

%s%?it<%?in<%in. |>%it|%fn>
%s%?ia<%ia|%?d2<%d2|(root)>>
%s%?id<%id|%?d1<%d1|(root)>> %?iy<(%iy)|>

%pc/%pt [%pp:%pe]
%fbkBit %?fv<avg|> %?iv<(id3v%iv)|(no id3)>

%pm
