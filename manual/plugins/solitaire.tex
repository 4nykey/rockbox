This is the classic Klondike solitaire game for Rockbox.
This is probably the best-known solitaire in the world. Many people 
don't even realize that other games exist. Though the name may not 
be familiar, the game itself certainly is. This is due in no small 
part to Microsoft's inclusion of the the game in every version of 
Windows. Though popular, the odds of winning are rather low, perhaps 
one in thirty hands.
