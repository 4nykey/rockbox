Installing the bootloader is only needed once. It simply requires you
to replace a file on your \dap{} with the Rockbox bootloader. To be able
booting the original firmware please make sure to rename the original file
properly. If you ever wish to uninstall Rockbox you should keep a backup copy
of the original file.

\begin{itemize}
\item Download the Rockbox bootloader. \fixme{Currently there isn't a
  prebuild bootloader available and you'll need to build it yourself.
  This is described in the wiki. Once a prebuild bootloader is available
  the link comes here. Have a look at \download{bootloader/}.}
\item Starting at the root folder of your player browse into the folder
  \fname{GBSYSTEM} and from that into the subfolder \fname{FWIMG}.
  These folders are hidden. You can enter them by simply typing the name in
  Windows explorers location bar or changing the display settings.
\item In that folder you'll find a file called \fname{FWIMG01.DAT}. Rename
  the file to \fname{FWIMG01.DAT.ORIG}. Make sure you spelled that name
  correctly as it is needed for booting the \playerman{} firmware.
\item Now copy the file \fname{FWIMG01.DAT} you downloaded to that folder.
  Make sure the spelling is correct.
\end{itemize}
