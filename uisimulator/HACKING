                               HACKING ROCKBOX

Terminology

  The hardware is mainly separated in two different versions. The "Player" is
  the Archos Jukebox Player 6000 and Archos Studio 20, while the "Recorder" is
  the Archos Recorder 20. The "Player" has a character-based LCD screen with 2
  lines of 11 letters and a big round thing on the keypad (featuring 6
  different keys), while the "Recorder" has a graphical LCD and has all its 10
  keys separate.

1. Get Sources

  The the very latest sources off the CVS server. Get the 'firmware' dir and
  the 'uisimulator' dir on the same dir level, to make it easier to build
  things (some of the files assume this hierarchy).

  All CVS details can be found here: http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/cvs.html

2. Build Uisimulator

  For the X11 simulator, change directory to uisimulator/x11.
 
  Edit the "DISPLAY" variable in the Makefile to match the target LCD you want
  to build the simulator for.

  Run 'make'.

3. Run Uisimulator

  To create a simulated disk drive for the simulator to see, create a
  subdirectory named 'archos' and populate it with a bunch of test
  files/directories.

  Run 'rockboxui'.

4. Target Keypad Equivalents

  The keyboard's numerical keypad is used to simulate the Archos keypads:

  Keyboard   Generic Archos
  --------   --------------
  +          ON
  8          UP
  2          DOWN
  4          LEFT
  6          RIGHT
             
  Keyboard   Recorder-only
  --------   --------------
  Enter      OFF
  5          PLAY
  /          F1
  *          F2
  -          F3

  Keyboard   Player-only
  --------   --------------
  [fill in]  MENU
  [fill in]  PLAY
  [fill in]  STOP
