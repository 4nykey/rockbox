When you're on Linux, just type "make linux" to compile all the utilities (make
sure you have libusb-dev installed).
For cleaning: "make clean-linux"

When you're on Windows, install MingW32 and LibUSB-Win32 and edit "Makefile" to
make sure "WIN_DRIVERS_LIBUSB_DIR" is set correctly.
For cleaning: "make clean-win"

That's all!
