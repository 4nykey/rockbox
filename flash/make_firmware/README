This tool composes a firmware file, out of:
1. Template for the first Flash page
2. Bootloader
3. Archos image
4. Rockbox image

Use with extreme caution, the components have to match!
The aspects are:
- Model (Player, Recorder, FM, V2)
- boot type (standard boot ROM or ROMless)

Such a firmware file can then be programmed with "firmware_flash.rock".
