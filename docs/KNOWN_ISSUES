This is a list of known "issues" in the current Rockbox.

These are flaws/bugs we know of that are not likely to be fixed within a
reasonable time so we list them here and close the bug tracker entries for
them.

FS#894 - When the complete playlist fits in the mpeg buffer, and the playlist
  is played multiple times, the tracks are reloaded from disk multiple times
  instead of loaded only once.

FS#2147 - It's a bug in the MAS. It starts bitshifting data on occasion. High
  load on the MAS makes this behaviour more likely (high recording level, high
  quality setting, high sample rate). It's impossible to avoid, but there are
  plans to implement a recording 'framewalker' that checks recorded data and
  restarts recording when the MAS starts delivering bitshifted data.

FS#4937 - A constant rhythmic ticking noise occurs in the right
  channel. Believed to be related to our slow I2C implementation, and occurs
  when the battery status and/or realtime clock are updated (the battery is
  read at up-to 2.5hz and the clock at up-to 1hz). Nothing is going to change
  with it until someone spends a lot of time analyzing the portalplayer's I2C
  control registers, or finds a datasheet for the damned thing.
