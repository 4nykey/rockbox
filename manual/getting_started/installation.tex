\chapter{Installation}\label{sec:installation}

Installing Rockbox is generally a quick and easy procedure. However
before beginning there are a few things it is important to know.

\section{Before Starting}

\opt{e200}{\fixme{NOTE: These instructions will not work on the 
``Rhapsody'' version of the E200 series (also known as E200R). Please 
follow the instructions at 
\url{http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SansaE200RInstallation}.}}

\opt{ipodnano,ipodvideo,e200,c200}{
\begin{description}  
\item[Supported hardware versions.] 
    \opt{ipodnano}{
    The \playertype{} is available in multiple versions, not
    all of which run Rockbox.  Rockbox presently runs only on 
    the original Ipod Nano. Rockbox does
    \emph{not} run on the second, third, or fourth generation Ipod Nano.
    For information on identifying which Ipod you own, see this page on
    Apple's website: \url{http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n61688}.
  }
  \opt{ipodvideo}{
    The \playertype{} is the 5th/5.5th generation \playerman{} only.
    Rockbox does \emph{not} run on the newer, 6th/Classic generation Ipod. 
    For information on identifying which Ipod you own, see this page on Apple's 
    website: \url{http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n61688}.
  }
  \opt{e200,c200}{
    The \playertype{} is available in multiple versions, not
    all of which run Rockbox.  Rockbox doesn't run on the
    newer v2 models. They can be identified
    by checking the Sandisk firmware version number under 
    Settings $\rightarrow$ Info. The v1
    firmware is named 01.xx.xx, while the v2 firmware begins with 03.
  }
\end{description}
}

\opt{h300}{
\begin{description}
  \item[DRM capability.] If your \dap{} has a US firmware, then by installing Rockbox you will
  \emph{permanently} lose the ability to playback files with DRM.
\end{description}
}

\begin{description}
\item[USB connection.] To transfer Rockbox to your \dap{} you need to
  connect it to your computer. For manual installation/uninstallation, or 
  should autodetection fail during automatic installation, you need to know 
  where to access the \dap{}. On Windows this means you need to know 
  the drive letter associated with the \dap{}. On Linux you need to know
  the mount point of your \dap{}. On Mac OS X you need to know the volume
  name of your \dap{}.

  \opt{ipod}{
    If you have Itunes installed and it is configured to open automatically
    when your \dap{} is attached (the default behaviour), 
    then wait for it to open and then quit it. You
    also need to ensure the ``Enable use as disk'' option is enabled for
    your \dap{} in Itunes. Your \dap{} should then enter disk mode
    automatically when connected to a
    computer via USB. If your computer does not recognise your \dap{}, you may
    need to enter disk mode manually. Disconnect your \dap{} from the
    computer. Hard reset the \dap{} by pressing and holding the \ButtonMenu{} and
    \ButtonSelect{} buttons simultaneously. As soon as the \dap{} resets, press
    and hold the \ButtonSelect{} and \ButtonPlay{} buttons simultaneously. Your
    \dap{} should enter disk mode and you can try reconnecting to the computer.
  }
  \opt{ipod3g,ipod4g,ipodcolor,ipodmini}{
    \index{Firewire}Firewire detection is not supported in Rockbox at 
    the moment. Please use USB only.
  }
  \opt{x5}{
    When instructed to connect/disconnect the USB cable, always use
    the USB port through the subpack, not the side 'USB Host' port. The side port
    is intended to be used for USB OTG connections only (digital cameras, memory
    sticks, etc.).
  }    
  \opt{sansa}{The following steps require you to change the setting in
    \setting{Settings $\rightarrow$ USB Mode} to \setting{MSC} from within the
    original firmware.

    \warn{Never extract files to your \dap{} while it is in recovery mode.}
  }
  \opt{h10,h10_5gb}{
    The installation requires you to use UMS mode and so
    may require use of the UMS trick, whereby it is possible to force a MTP
    \playertype{} to start up in UMS mode as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Ensure the \dap{} is fully powered off by \opt{h10}{using a pin to
        push the small reset button inside the hole between the Hold switch and
        remote control connector.}\opt{h10_5gb}{removing the battery and putting it back in again.}
        \item Connect your \playertype{} to the computer using the data cable.
        \item Hold \ButtonRight{} and push \ButtonPower{} to turn the \dap{} on.
        \item Continue holding \ButtonRight{} until the USB Connected screen appears.
        \item The \dap{} will now appear as a regular disk on your computer.
      \end{enumerate}
      \note{Once Rockbox has been installed, when you shut down your \dap{} from Rockbox it will totally
       power the player off so step 1 is no longer necessary.}
  }
  \opt{gigabeatf}{During installation, do not connect your \dap{}
  using the cradle but plug the USB cable directly to the \dap{}.
  } 
\end{description}

\opt{ipod,sansa}{
\begin{description}
  \item[Administrator/Root rights.] Installing the bootloader portion of Rockbox
  requires you to have administrative (Windows) or root (Linux) rights.
  Consequently when doing either the automatic or manual bootloader install,
  please ensure that you are logged in with an administrator account or have root rights.
\end{description}
}

\opt{ipod}{
\begin{description}
  \item[File system format.] Rockbox only works on Ipods formatted with
  the FAT32 filesystem (i.e. Ipods initialised by Itunes
  for Windows). It does not work with the HFS+ filesystem (i.e. Ipods
  initialised by Itunes for the Mac). More information and instructions for
  converting an Ipod to FAT32 can be found on the
  \wikilink{IpodConversionToFAT32} wiki
  page on the Rockbox website. Note that after conversion, you can still use
  a FAT32 Ipod with a Mac.
\end{description}
}

\section{Installing Rockbox}\label{sec:installing_rockbox}\index{Installation}
There are two ways to install Rockbox: automated and manual. The automated
way is the preferred method of installing Rockbox for the majority of
people. Rockbox Utility is a graphical 
application that does almost everything for you.
However, should you encounter a problem, then the manual way is
still available to you.

\opt{MASCODEC}{Rockbox itself comes as a single package. There is no need
  to install additional software to run Rockbox.}
\opt{swcodec} {
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{There are three separate components,
    two of which need to be installed in order to run Rockbox:}
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{There are two separate components
    which need to be installed in order to run Rockbox:}

\begin{description}
\opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{
\item[The \playerman{} bootloader.]
  The \playerman{} bootloader is the program that tells your \dap{} how to load
  and start the original firmware. It is also responsible for any emergency,
  recovery, or disk modes on your \dap{}. This bootloader is stored in special flash
  memory in your \playerman{} and comes factory-installed. It is not necessary
  to modify this in order to install Rockbox.}

\item[The Rockbox bootloader.] \index{Bootloader}
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{The Rockbox bootloader is loaded from disk by
  the \playerman{} bootloader. It is responsible for loading the Rockbox
  firmware and for providing the dual boot function. It directly replaces the
  \playerman{} firmware in the \daps{} boot sequence.
  \opt{gigabeatf}{\note{Dual boot does not currently work on the Gigabeat.}}}

  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{
  The bootloader is the program that tells your
  \dap{} how to load and start other components of Rockbox and for providing
  the dual boot function. This is the component of Rockbox that is installed
  to the flash memory of your \playerman.
  \opt{iaudio}{\note{Dual boot does not currently work on the \playertype{}.}}}

\item[The Rockbox firmware.]
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_IN_FLASH}{Unlike the \playerman{} firmware, which runs
  entirely from flash memory,}
  \opt{HAVE_RB_BL_ON_DISK}{Similar to the \playerman{} firmware,}
  most of the Rockbox code is contained in a
  ``build'' that resides on your \daps{} drive. This makes it easy to
  update Rockbox. The build consists of a directory called
  \fname{.rockbox} which contains all of the Rockbox files, and is 
  located in the root of your \daps{} drive.

\end{description}
}

\nopt{player} {
    Apart from the required parts there are some addons you might be interested
    in installing.
    \begin{description}
    \item[Fonts.] Rockbox can load custom fonts. The fonts are
        distributed as a separate package and thus need to be installed
        separately. They are not required to run Rockbox itself but
        a lot of themes require the fonts package to be installed.

    \item[Themes.] The appearance of Rockbox can be customised by themes. Depending
        on your taste you might want to install additional themes to change
        the look of Rockbox.
    \end{description}
}

\subsection{Automated Installation}

To automatically install Rockbox, download the official installer and
housekeeping tool \caps{Rockbox Utility}. It allows you to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatically install all needed components for using Rockbox
        (``Minimal Installation'').
\item Automatically install all suggested components (``Complete Installation'').
\item Selectively install optional components.
\nopt{player}{\item Install additional fonts and themes.}
\item Install voice files and generate talk clips.
\item Uninstall all components you installed using Rockbox Utility.
\end{itemize}

Prebuilt binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X are
available at the \wikilink{RockboxUtility} wiki page.\\

When first starting \caps{Rockbox Utility} run ``Autodetect'',
found in the configuration dialog (File $\rightarrow$ Configure). Autodetection
can detect most player types. If autodetection fails or is unable to detect 
the mountpoint, make sure to enter the correct values. The mountpoint indicates
the location of the \dap{} in your filesystem. On Windows, this is the drive
letter the \dap{} gets assigned, on other systems this is a path in the
filesystem.\\*

\opt{ipodvideo}
    {\note{Autodetection is unable to distinguish between the
    \playerman{} 30~GB and 60~GB / 80~GB models and defaults to the
    30~GB model. This will usually work but you might want to check the
    detected value, especially if you experience problems with Rockbox.}
}

\opt{h100,h300}{
  Rockbox Utility will ask you for a compatible copy of the original
  firmware. This is because for legal reasons we cannot distribute
  the bootloader directly. Instead, we have to patch the Iriver firmware
  with the Rockbox bootloader.

  Download a supported version of the Iriver firmware for your 
  \playername{} from the Iriver website, links can be found on 
  \wikilink{IriverBoot}.
 
  Supported Iriver firmware versions currently include 
  \opt{h100}{1.63US, 1.63EU, 1.63K, 1.65US, 1.65EU, 1.65K, 1.66US, 
    1.66EU and 1.66K. Note that the H140 uses the same firmware as the H120;
    H120 and H140 owners should use the firmware called \fname{ihp\_120.hex}.
    Likewise, the iHP110 and iHP115 use the same firmware, called 
    \fname{ihp\_100.hex}. Be sure to use the correct firmware file for 
    your player.}
    \opt{h300}{1.28K, 1.28EU, 1.28J, 1.29K, 1.29J and 1.30EU.
    \note{The US \playername{} firmware is not supported and cannot be
    patched to be used with the bootloader. If you wish to install Rockbox
    on a US \playername{}, you must first install a non-US version of the
    original firmware and then install one of the supported versions patched
    with the Rockbox bootloader. 
    \warn{Installing non-US firmware on a US \playername{} will
    permanently remove DRM support from the player.}}}

  If the file that you downloaded is a \fname{.zip} file, use an unzip 
  utility like mentioned in the prerequisites section to extract
  the \fname{.hex} from the \fname{.zip} file
  to your desktop. Likewise, if the file that you downloaded is an 
  \fname{.exe} file, double-click on the \fname{.exe} file to extract 
  the \fname{.hex} file to your desktop.
  When running Linux you should be able to extract \fname{.exe}
  files using \fname{unzip}.
}

\subsubsection{Choosing a Rockbox version}\label{sec:choosing_version}

There are three different versions of Rockbox available from the
Rockbox website:
\label{Version}
Release version, current build and archived daily build. You need to decide which one
you want to install and get the appropriate version for your \dap{}. If you
select either ``Minimal Installation'' or ``Complete Installation'' from the
``Quick Start'' tab, then Rockbox Utility will automatically install the
release version of Rockbox. Using the ``Installation'' tab will allow you
to select which version you wish to install.

\begin{description}

\item[Release.] The release version is the latest stable release, free
   of known critical bugs. For a manual install, the current stable release of Rockbox is
   available at \url{http://www.rockbox.org/download/}.
  
\item[Current Build.] The current build is built at each source code change to
  the Rockbox SVN repository and represents the current state of Rockbox
  development. This means that the build could contain bugs but most of
  the time is safe to use. For a manual install, you can download the current build from  
  \url{http://build.rockbox.org/}.

\item[Archived Build.] In addition to the release version and the current build,
  there is also an archive of daily builds available for download. These are
  built once a day from the latest source code in the SVN repository. For a manual install,
  you can download archived builds from \url{http://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml}.

\end{description}

\note{Because current and archived builds are development versions that 
      change frequently, they may behave differently than described in this manual, 
      or they may introduce new (and potentially annoying) bugs. Unless you wish to
      try the latest and greatest features at the price of possibly greater instability,
      or you wish to help with development, you should stick with the release.\\*}

Please now go to \reference{ref:finish_install} to complete the installation procedure.

\subsection{Manual Installation}

The manual installation method is still available to you, should you need or desire it
by following the instructions below. If you have used Rockbox Utility
to install Rockbox, then you do not need to follow the next section and can skip
straight to \reference{ref:finish_install}

\subsubsection{Installing the firmware}\label{sec:installing_firmware}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download your chosen version of Rockbox from the links in the
  previous section.
\opt{ipodvideo}{\note{There are separate versions of Rockbox for the 30GB and 
60GB/80GB models.  You must ensure you download the correct version for your 
\dap{}.}}

\item Connect your \dap{} to the computer via USB
  \opt{ipod3g,ipod4g,ipodmini,ipodcolor}{ or Firewire} as described in
  the manual that came with your \dap{}.

\item Take the \fname{.zip} file that you downloaded and use
 the ``Extract all'' command of your unzip program to extract 
 the files onto your \dap{}.

\note{The entire contents of the \fname{.zip} file should be extracted 
directly to the root of your \daps{} drive. Do not try to
create a separate directory on your \dap{} for the Rockbox
files! The \fname{.zip} file already contains the internal
structure that Rockbox needs.}

\end{enumerate}

\opt{archos}{
 If the contents of the \fname{.zip} file are extracted correctly, you will
 have a file called \fname{\firmwarefilename} in the main directory of your
 \daps{} drive, and also a directory called \fname{.rockbox}, which contains a
 number of other directories and system files needed by Rockbox.
}

% This has nothing to do with swcodec, just that these players need our own
% bootloader so we can decide where we want the main binary.
\opt{swcodec}{
 If the contents of the \fname{.zip} file are extracted correctly, you will
 have a directory called \fname{.rockbox}, which contains all the files needed
 by Rockbox, in the main directory of your \daps{} drive.
}

\opt{swcodec}{

}

\subsection{Finishing the install}\label{ref:finish_install}

\opt{gigabeatf}{
  After installing you \emph{need} to power-cycle the 
  \dap{} by doing the following steps. Failure to do so may result in problems.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Safely eject / unmount your \dap{} and unplug the USB cable.
  \item Unplug any power adapter.
  \item Hold the \ButtonPower{} button to turn off the \dap{}.
  \item Slide the battery switch located on the bottom of the \dap{} from 
  `on' to `off'.
  \item Slide the battery switch back from `off' to `on'.
  \end{itemize}
}

\opt{m5,x5}{
  After installing you \emph{need} to power-cycle the 
  \dap{} by doing the following steps.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Safely eject / unmount your \dap{} and unplug the USB cable.
  \item Hold the \ButtonPower{} button to turn off the \dap{}. 
  \item Insert the charger. The Rockbox bootloader will automatically be flashed.
  \end{itemize}
}

\opt{h10,h10_5gb,ipod,mrobe100,sansa,archos}{
  Safely eject / unmount the USB drive, unplug the cable and restart.
}

\opt{h100,h300}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Safely eject / unmount your \dap{}.
  
  \item \warn{Before proceeding further, make sure that your player has a full charge
  or that it is connected to the power adaptor. Interrupting the next step
  due to a power failure most likely will brick your \dap{}.}
  Update your \daps{} firmware with the patched bootloader. To do this, turn
  the jukebox on. Press and hold the \ButtonSelect{} button to enter the main menu,
  and navigate to \setting{General $\rightarrow$ Firmware Upgrade}. Select
  \setting{Yes} when asked to confirm if you want to upgrade the 
  firmware. The \playerman{} will display a message indicating that the
  firmware update is in progress. Do \emph{not} interrupt this process. When the
  firmware update is complete the player will turn itself off. (The update
  firmware process usually takes a minute or so.). You are now ready to go.
\end{itemize}
}


\subsection{Enabling Speech Support (optional)}\label{sec:enabling_speech_support}
\index{Speech}\index{Installation!Optional Steps}
If you wish to use speech support you will also need a voice file. Voice files
allow Rockbox to speak the user interface to you. Rockbox Utility can install
an English voice file, or you can download it from \url{http://www.rockbox.org/daily.shtml} 
and unzip it to the root of your \dap{}.
Rockbox Utility can also aid you in the creation of voice files with different voices
or in other languages if you have a suitable speech engine installed on your computer.
Voice menus are enabled by default and will come
into effect after a reboot. See \reference{ref:Voiceconfiguration} for details
on voice settings.
Rockbox Utility can also aid in the production of talk files, which allow Rockbox
to speak file and folder names.

\section{Running Rockbox}
\nopt{ipod,e200}{Unplug any connected power supply and turn the unit off. When
you next turn the unit on, Rockbox should load.}%
\opt{ipod}{Hard resetting the Ipod by holding
  \opt{IPOD_4G_PAD}{\ButtonMenu{}+\ButtonSelect{}}%
  \opt{IPOD_3G_PAD}{\ButtonMenu{}+\ButtonPlay{}}
  for a couple of seconds until the \dap{} resets. Now Rockbox should load.
} %
\opt{e200}{Your e200 will automatically reboot and Rockbox should load. }%
When you see the Rockbox splash screen, Rockbox is loaded and ready for
use.

\opt{ipod}{
  \note{
    If you have loaded music onto your \dap{} using Itunes, 
    you will not be able to see your music properly in the \setting{File Browser}. 
    This is because Itunes changes your files' names and hides them in 
    directories in the \fname{Ipod\_Control} directory. Files placed on your 
    \dap{} using Itunes can be viewed by initialising and using Rockbox's database.
    See \reference{ref:database} for more information.
  }
}

\section{Updating Rockbox}
Rockbox can be easily updated with Rockbox Utility.
You can also update Rockbox manually - download a Rockbox build
as detailed above, and unzip the build to the root directory
of your \dap{} as in the manual installation stage. If your unzip
program asks you whether to overwrite files, choose the ``Yes to all'' option.
The new build will be installed over your current build.

The bootloader only changes rarely, and should not normally
need to be updated.

\note{If you use Rockbox Utility be aware that it cannot detect manually
        installed components.}

\section{Uninstalling Rockbox}\index{Installation!uninstall}

\nopt{gigabeatf,m5,x5,archos,mrobe100}{
  \note{The Rockbox bootloader allows you to choose between Rockbox and 
  the original firmware. (See \reference{ref:Dualboot} for more information.)}
}

\subsection{Automatic Uninstallation}
You can uninstall Rockbox automatically by using Rockbox Utility. If you
installed Rockbox manually you can still use Rockbox Utility for uninstallation
but will not be able to do this selectively.

\opt{h100,h300}{\note{Rockbox Utility cannot uninstall the bootloader due to
the fact that it requires a flashing procedure. To uninstall the bootloader
completely follow the manual uninstallation instructions below.}}

\subsection{Manual Uninstallation}

\opt{archos}{
  If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software,
  connect the \dap{} to your computer, and delete the
  \fname{\firmwarefilename} file.
}

\opt{h10,h10_5gb}{
  If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software,
  connect the \dap{} to your computer, and delete the
  \opt{h10}{\fname{H10\_20GC.mi4}}\opt{h10_5gb}{\fname{H10.mi4}} file and rename
  \fname{OF.mi4} to \opt{h10}{\fname{H10\_20GC.mi4}}\opt{h10_5gb}{\fname{H10.mi4}}
  in the \fname{System} directory on your \playertype{}. As in the installation,
  it may be necessary to first put your device into UMS mode.
}

\opt{mrobe100}{
  If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software,
  connect the \dap{} to your computer, and delete the
  \fname{pp5020.mi4} file and rename
  \fname{OF.mi4} to \fname{pp5020.mi4}
  in the \fname{System} directory on your \playertype{}.
}

\opt{e200}{
  If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software,
  connect the \dap{} to your computer, and follow the instructions to install
  the bootloader, but when prompted by sansapatcher, enter \texttt{u} for uninstall,
  instead of \texttt{i} for install. As in the installation, it may be necessary to
  first put your device into MSC mode.
}

\optv{ipod}{
  To uninstall Rockbox and go back to using just the original Ipod software, connect
  the \dap{} to your computer and follow the instructions to install 
  the bootloader but, when prompted by ipodpatcher, enter \texttt{u} for uninstall 
  instead of \texttt{i} for install.
}

\opt{m5,x5}{
  If you would like to go back to using the original \playerman{} software,
  connect the \dap{} to your computer, download the original \playername{}
  firmware from the \playerman{} website, and copy it to the \fname{FIRMWARE}
  directory on your \playername{}. Turn off the \dap{}, remove the USB cable
  and insert the charger. The original firmware will automatically be flashed.
}

\opt{h100,h300}{
    If you want to remove the Rockbox bootloader, simply flash an unpatched
    \playerman{} firmware. Be aware that doing so will also remove the bootloader
    USB mode. As that mode can come in quite handy (especially if you experience
   disk errors) it is recommended to keep the bootloader. It also
    gives you the possibility of trying Rockbox anytime later by simply
    installing the distribution files.
    \opt{h100}{
      The Rockbox bootloader will automatically start the original firmware if
      the \fname{.rockbox} directory has been deleted.
    }
    \opt{h300}{
      Although if you retain the Rockbox bootloader, you will need to hold the
      \ButtonRec{} button each time you want to start the original firmware.
    }
}

If you wish to clean up your disk, you may also wish to delete the
\fname{.rockbox} directory and its contents.
\nopt{m5,x5}{Turn the \playerman{} off.
  Turn the \dap{} back on and the original \playerman{} software will load.}

\section{Troubleshooting}
\begin{description}
  \item[``-1 error'']
  If you receive a ``-1 error'' from the bootloader, then
  the bootloader cannot find the Rockbox firmware. This is usually a result of
  not extracting the contents of the \fname{.zip} file to the proper location,
  and should not happen when Rockbox has been installed with Rockbox Utility.

  To fix this, either install Rockbox with the Rockbox Utility which will take care
  of this for you, or recheck the Manual Install section to see where the files
  need to be located.

\opt{sansa,ipod}{
  \item[Bootloader install problems]
  If you have trouble installing the bootloader,
  please ensure that you are either logged in as an administrator (Windows), or
  you have root rights (Linux)}

\opt{h100,h300}{
  \item[Immediately loading original firmware.]
  If the original firmware is immediately
  loaded without the Rockbox bootloader appearing first, then the Rockbox bootloader
  has not been correctly installed. The original firmware update will only perform
  the update if the filename is correct, including case. Make sure that the patched
  Iriver firmware is called \fname{.hex}.}
