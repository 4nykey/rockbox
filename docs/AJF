Description of the binary AJF font file format (version 2)

Index    Descripton

00       MAGIC1 (0xBD)
01       MAGIC2 (0xFC) used to make sure this is an ajf font
02       Unused, planned use: "code page"
03 - 22  ASCII text holding the font name
23 - 24  "bound width"  (high 8 bits, low 8 bits)
25 - 26  "bound height" (high 8 bits, low 8 bits)
26 - 28  first character in the font
29 - 2a  number of characters in the font (alwasys 0x00ff now)
2b -     map offset table starts here. Each offset entry is two bytes:
         offset highbyte, offset lowbyte

         The offset is number of bytes from the start of this file, to where
         in the font data this particular char's font data starts.

         There is one offset entry for each character in this font, starting
         with 'first character' (set above) and ending when all the 'number
         of characters' have been stored.

?? -     Font data. First four bytes width, height, dispx and dispy and then
         the glyph in Rockbox-internal image-format. That means column-wise
         left-to-right for the full width, the first 8 pixels of height. Then
         follows the next 8 pixels of height left-to-right.

         We don't currently support fonts larger than 16 pixels. (This font
         file format would have no problem with bigger sizes, but the internal
         bitmap function has.)
