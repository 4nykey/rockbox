\section{File View}
The File View menu deals with options relating to how the File Browser 
displays files.
%
\begin{description}
\item[Sort Case Sensitive:]
  If this option is set to \setting{Yes}, all files that start with upper case 
  letters will be listed first, followed by all files that begin with lower 
  case letters.  If this option is set to NO, then case will be ignored when 
  sorting files.
\item[Sort Directories:]
  This option controls how Rockbox sorts folders.  The default is to sort 
  them alphabetically. \setting{By date} sorts them with the oldest folder first. 
  \setting{By newest date} sorts them with the newest folder first.
  
\item[Sort Files:]
  This option controls how Rockbox sorts files.  All of the options for 
  \setting{Sort Directories} are available in this option.  In addition, there 
  is a \setting{By type} option which sorts files alphabetically by their type 
  (such as \fname{.mp3}) then alphabetically within each type.
  
\item[\label{ref:ShowFiles}Show Files:]
  This option controls which files are displayed in the File Browser.

  \begin{description}
  \item[All:] The \setting{File Browser} displays all files and directories.
    Extensions are shown. No files or directories are hidden.
  \item[Supported:] The \setting{File Browser} displays all directories and
    files supported by Rockbox (see \reference{ref:Supportedfileformats}).
    Files and directories starting with \fname{.} or with the ``hidden''
    flag set are hidden.
  \item[Music:] The \setting{File Browser} displays only folders, playlists and
    the supported \emph{audio} file formats. Extensions are stripped. Files and
    directories starting with \fname{.} or with the ``hidden'' flag set are
    hidden.
  \item[Playlists:] The \setting{File Browser} displays only directories and playlists,
    for simplified navigation.
  \item[ID3 Database:] This shows the files based on the \setting{Tag Cache}
    information, thus disabling the \setting{File Browser}. You can browse the
    database by various tags and search them. Only information present
    in music file tags are shown. For a detailed description of
    \setting{Tag Cache} refer to \reference{ref:tagcache}.

  \end{description}
  
\item[Follow Playlist:] 
  This option determines what directory the \setting{File Browser} displays
  first. If \setting{Follow Playlist} is set to \setting{Yes}, when you enter
  the \setting{File Browser} from the WPS, you will find yourself in the same
  directory as the currently playing file. If \setting{Follow Playlist} is set
  to \setting{No}, when you enter the \setting{File Browser} from the WPS, you
  will find yourself in the directory you were in when you last left the
  \setting{File Browser}.
  
\item[Show Icons:]
  Rockbox has the ability to display an icon to the left of the file
  in the \setting{File Browser}. For details of these icons, please see
  \reference{ref:Supportedfileformats}.

\item[Show Path:]
  If this setting is set to \setting{Full Path} the full path to the current
  directory will be displayed on the first line in the \setting{File Browser}.
  If set to \setting{Current Directory Only} only the name of the current
  directory will be displayed.

\item[Tag Cache:]
  This option allows you to configure the Tag Cache.
  See \reference{ref:tagcache} for more information about using
  the Tag Cache.
