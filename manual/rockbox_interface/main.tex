In the unlikely event of a software failure, a hardware power off can be performed by holding down STOP until the Jukebox power light goes off. This works for all models of Jukebox.

\section{\label{ref:file_browser}File Browser}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rockbox_interface/images/ss-file-browser-\genericimg.png}
\end{center}
The file browser helps you navigate through the files on your \dap, entering folders and executing the default action on each file. To help us differentiate files, each file format is displayed with an icon. You can select which file types are displayed (see page \pageref{ref:ShowFiles}).

\subsection{\label{ref:Filemenu}\label{ref:PartIISectionFM}File Menu}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rockbox_interface/images/ss-file-menu-\genericimg.png}
\end{center}

This menu operates on the file that was selected in the browser. It offers the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Open with:} Runs a viewer plugin on the file. Normally the filetype of a file is detected and the appropriate plugin is run automatically when you press play on it.  Use this menu if for some reason you want to override the default action and select a viewer by hand.  See page \textmd{\pageref{ref:Viewersplugins}} for more details on viewers. For example, this would be used to view a text file with a non-standard extension, i.e. not ending with .txt.
\item \textbf{Playlist:} Change to the Playlist submenu (see below).
\item \textbf{Rename:} This function lets the user modify a file name.
\item \textbf{Cut:} Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard and marks it to be 'cut'.
\item \textbf{Copy:} Copies the name of the currently selected file or directory to the clipboard and marks it to be 'copied'.
\item \textbf{Paste:} Only visible if a file or directory name is on the clipboard. When selected it will move or copy the clipboard to the current directory. 
\item \textbf{Delete:} Only files can be deleted, not folders. Rockbox will ask for confirmation before deleting a file. Press PLAY to confirm deletion or any other key to cancel.
\item \textbf{Delete Directory:} Deletes the folder pointed to by the cursor and all the files and folders contained in it.  Use with caution.
\item \textbf{Create Directory:} Makes a new folder in the current folder on the disk.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\label{ref:Playlistsubmenu}Playlist Submenu}
If the playlist submenu is invoked on a directory, it will act on all the files within that directory.  If invoked on a playlist it will act on all the files in that playlist. Otherwise it acts only on the current file.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rockbox_interface/images/ss-playlist-menu-112x64x1.png}
\end{center}
This menu provides the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Insert:} Add track(s) to playlist. If no other tracks have been inserted then the selected track will be added immediately after current playing track, otherwise they will be added to end of insertion list.
\item \textbf{Insert next: }Add track(s) immediately after current playing track, no matter what else has been inserted.
\item \textbf{Insert last: }Add track(s) to end of playlist.
\item \textbf{Queue: } Queue is the same as Insert except queued tracks are deleted immediately from the playlist after they've been played. Also, queued tracks are not saved to the playlist file (see page \pageref{ref:playlistoptions}).
\item \textbf{Queue next:} Queue track(s) immediately after current playing track.
\item \textbf{Queue last: }Queue track(s) at end of playlist.
\end{itemize}

You can insert a track, directory or playlist even if nothing is currently playing. In this case, a new playlist is created with only the selected tracks and then play is started.\\
\textbf{Note}: The dynamic playlist is saved so resume will restore it exactly as before shutdown.

\subsection{Virtual Keyboard}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rockbox_interface/images/ss-virtual-keyboard-112x64x1.png}
\end{center}
This is the virtual keyboard that is used when entering file names in Rockbox.

\section{\label{ref:WPS}While Playing Screen}
The While Playing Screen (WPS) displays various pieces of information about the currently playing audio file:
%
\opt{recorder,recorderv2fm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Status bar: Battery level, charger status, volume, play mode, repeat mode, shuffle mode and clock.
\item Scrolling path+filename of the current song.
\item The ID3 track name.
\item The ID3 album name.
\item The ID3 artist name.
\item Bit rate. VBR files display average bitrate and ``(avg)''
\item Elapsed and total time.
\item A slidebar progress meter representing where in the song you are.
\item Peak meter.
\end{itemize}

Notes:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of lines shown depends on the size of the font used.
\item The peak meter is only visible if you turn off the status bar or if
using a small font that gives 8 or more display lines.
\end{itemize}
}
%
\opt{player}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Playlist index/Playlist size: Artist {}- Title.
\item Current{}-time Progress{}-indicator Left.

  \subsection{Peak Meter}
  The peak meter can be displayed on the While Playing Screen and consists
  of several indicators.  For a picture of the peak meter, please see the
  While Recording Screen on page \pageref{ref:Whilerecordingscreen}.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The bar: }
    This is the wide horizontal bar. It represents the current volume value.
  \item \textbf{The peak indicator:} 
    This is a little vertical line at the rightend of the bar. It indicates the peak volume value that occurred recently.
  \item \textbf{The clip indicator: }
    This is a little black block that is displayed at the very right of the scale when an overflow occurs. It usually doesn't show up during normal playback unless you play an audio file that is distorted heavily. If you encounter clipping while recording your recording will sound distorted. You should lower the gain. Note that the clip detection is not very precise. Clipping might occur without being indicated.
  \item \textbf{The scale: }
    Between the indicators of the right and left channel there are little dots. These dots represent important volume values. In linear mode each dot is a 10\% mark. In dbfs mode the dots represent the following values (from right to left): 0db, {}-3db, {}-6db, {}-9db, {}-12db, {}-18db, {}-24db, {}-30db, {}-40db, {}-50db, {}-60db.

\subsection{\label{ref:ID3viewer}ID3 Viewer}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rockbox_interface/images/ss-id3-viewer-112x64x1.png}
\end{center}

This screen is accessible from the WPS screen by pressing F1+ON (recorder) or MENU+ON (player).  It provides a detailed view of all the identity information about the current track that is stored in an MP3 file.  Use the LEFT and RIGHT (recorder) or PLUS and MINUS (player) keys to move through the information and the STOP key to exit the viewer.

\section{\label{ref:QuickScreenMenus}Quick Screen Menus}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
Rockbox handles function buttons in a different way to the Archos software. F1 is always bound to the menu function, while F2 and F3 enable two quick menus.

F2 displays some browse and play settings which are likely to be changed frequently. This settings are Shuffle mode, Repeat mode and the Show files options

Shuffle mode plays each track in the currently playing list in a random order rather than in the order shown in the browser.

Repeat mode repeats either a single track (One) or the entire playlist (All).

Show files determines what type files can be seen in the browser.  This can be just MP3 files and directories (Music), Playlists, MP3 files and directories  (Playlists), any files that Rockbox supports (Supported) or all files on the disk (All).

See page \pageref{ref:PlaybackOptions} for more information about these settings.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}\toprule
      \textbf{Key} & \textbf{Action} \\\midrule
      LEFT & Controls Shuffle mode setting \\
      RIGHT & Controls Repeat mode setting \\
      DOWN & Controls Show file setting \\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
F3 controls frequently used display options.

Scroll bar turns the display of the Scroll bar on the left of the screen on or off.

Status bar turns the status display at the top of the screen on or off. Upside down inverts the screen so that the top of the display appears nearest to the buttons.  This is sometimes useful when storing the \dap in a pocket.  Key assignments swap over with the display orientation where it is logical for them to do so.

See page \pageref{ref:Displayoptions} for more information about these settings.
