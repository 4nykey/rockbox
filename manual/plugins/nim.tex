Jukebox selected, and vice versa.

Pong game
\par}

The world's first arcade game comes to Rockbox.  This
is a ``tennis game'' for two players. The
left player uses LEFT and F1 to move and the right player uses RIGHT
and F3.  The aim is to prevent the ball leaving the screen.  The player
that loses the least balls wins.

\begin{table}
\begin{btnmap}{}{}
KEY & ACTION \\
F1 & Player 1 up \\
LEFT & Player 1 down \\
F3 & Player 2 up \\
RIGHT & Player 2 down \\
OFF & Quit \\
\end{btnmap}
