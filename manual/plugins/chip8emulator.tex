\subsection{\label{ref:Chip8emulator}Chip{}-8 Emulator}
The Chip{}-8 Emulator allows you to play many old chip8 games found on
the Net. It modifies Rockbox, so file extensions .ch8 will be
recognised as chip8 games. Just press PLAY on a .ch8 file to start a
game.

There are lots of tiny Chip8 games (usually only about 256 bytes to a
couple of KB) which were made popular by the HP48
calculator's emulator for them. The original Chip8 had
64x32 pixel graphics, and the new superchip emulator supports 128x64
graphics, which almost fits on the Recorder's display.
The only problem is they are based on a 4x4 keyboard, but since most
games do not use all of the buttons, this can easily be worked around.

Some places where can you can find .ch8 files:
