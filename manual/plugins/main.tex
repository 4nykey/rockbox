\chapter{Plugins}
\newpage
Plugins are little programs that Rockbox can load and run. Plugins have
the file extension .rock.  Most of them can be started from the main
menu if you put them in the \textbf{/.rockbox/rocks} directory. Press
PLAY on them to start them. 

Viewer plugins get started automatically by
``playing'' an associated file (i.e. text
files, chip8 games), or from the ``Open with'' option on the File menu.

Plugins listed here have the platforms they run under (Player for
Jukebox players, Recorder for Jukebox recorders including Jukebox FM,
and Ondio for the Ondio SP and FM).  If no platforms are listed then
the plugin runs on all Rockbox platforms.\\

\textbf{The plugin loader}
Only one plugin can be loaded at a time. Plugins run in the GUI thread
and have exclusive control over the user interface. This means you
cannot switch back and forth between a plugin and Rockbox. A plugin is
loaded, run and then exited, which returns control to Rockbox.  Music
will carry on playing whilst plugins are being run.

\section{\label{ref:Viewersplugins}Viewers}

Viewers are plugins which are associated with specific file extensions.
They cannot be run directly but are started by ``playing''
the associated file.  Viewers are stored in the
\textbf{/.rockbox/viewers/ }directory.

\subsection{\label{ref:Chip8emulator}Chip{}-8 Emulator (Recorder, Ondio)}
The Chip{}-8 Emulator allows you to play many old chip8 games found on
the Net. It modifies Rockbox, so file extensions .ch8 will be
recognised as chip8 games. Just press PLAY on a .ch8 file to start a
game.

There are lots of tiny Chip8 games (usually only about 256 bytes to a
couple of KB) which were made popular by the HP48
calculator's emulator for them. The original Chip8 had
64x32 pixel graphics, and the new superchip emulator supports 128x64
graphics, which almost fits on the Recorder's display.
The only problem is they are based on a 4x4 keyboard, but since most
games do not use all of the buttons, this can easily be worked around.

Some places where can you can find .ch8 files:

\begin{itemize}
\item The original chip8 patch had several attached:
\url{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=628509&group_id=44306&atid=439120}
\item Check out the HP48 chip games section:
\url{http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/games/chip/}
\item Check out the PC emulator by the guy who wrote the HP48 emulator:
\url{http://www.pdc.kth.se/~lfo/chip8/CHIP8.htm}
\item Links to other chip8 emulators: 
\url{http://www.zophar.net/chip8.html}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{JPEG viewer (Recorder, Ondio)}
Press PLAY on a .jpg file in order to view the contents using Rockbox's greyscale library.  Use the arrow keys to move around the image, PLAY to zoom in
and ON to zoom out.  Press OFF to exit the viewer.

Note: JPEGs that use progressive scan encoding are not supported and will produce an error.

\subsection{Movie Player (Recorder, Ondio)}
Play movies on your Jukebox!  In order to do
this, movies must be in AVI format, and then converted to .RVF,
Rockbox's own video format.  For more details on how to use this plugin, please see \url{http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/VideoTutorial}.

\subsection{Rockbox\_flash (Recorder, Ondio)}
{\centering\itshape
  [Warning: Image ignored] % Unhandled or unsupported graphics:
%\includegraphics[width=4.059cm,height=2.32cm]{images/rockbox-manual-img57.png}
 \newline
Rockbox flash
\par}

For ``playing'' .UCL files on flashed Jukeboxes. Reprograms the flash memory of
the Jukebox unit (see page \pageref{ref:Rockboxinflash} for details).

\subsection{Search}
This plugin can be used on playlists.  It searches through the playlist
that it is opened on looking for any occurrences of the string entered by the
user.  The results of this search are saved to a new playlist,
\textbf{search\_results.m3u}, within the same directory as the
original playlist.

\subsection{Sort}
This plugin takes a file and sorts it in  forward alphabetical order.  Case is
ignored.  This is useful for ordering playlists generated by the ``Create Playlist'' menu option (see page \pageref{ref:Playlistsubmenu}).

\subsection{Text Viewer}
This is a Viewer for text files with word wrap. Just press PLAY on a
.txt file to display it. Has controls to handle various styles of text
formatting. Has top{}-of{}-file and bottom{}-of{}-file buttons.  You
can view files without a .txt extension by using \textbf{Open with ..}
from the Play Screen menu

\subsubsection{Controls}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{F1 (Recorder) / ON{}-MINUS (Player): }
toggles Word mode between Wrap and Chop:

\begin{itemize}
\item Wrap breaks lines at white space or hyphen.
\item Chop breaks lines at the maximum column limit.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{F2 (Recorder) / ON{}-MENU{}-PLUS (Player): }
cycles Line mode through Normal, Join and Expand:

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal breaks lines at newline characters.
\item Join ignores unpaired newline characters  (i.e., joins lines). Useful for
adopting the orphans that occur with e{}-mail style (i.e.,pre{}-wrapped) text files.
\item Expand doubles unpaired newlines (i.e., adds a blank line). Useful
for making the paragraphs clearer in some book style text files.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{F3 (Recorder) / ON{}-PLUS (Player):} 
toggles View mode between Narrow and Wide:

\begin{itemize}
\item Narrow sets maximum column to the screen width.
\item Wide sets maximum column to 114. Useful for navigating large
files. (Currently, Wide and Join cannot be selected together.)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{ON{}-F1 (Recorder):} 
toggles Page mode between Normal and Overlap:

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal sets page{}-down/page{}-up to one full screen.
\item Overlap tells page{}-down/page{}-up to retain one line from
previous screen.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{ON{}-F3 (Recorder):} 
toggles Scrollbar mode, for the current View mode.

\begin{itemize}
\item Narrow mode has no scrollbar by default, until toggled.
\item Wide mode has a scrollbar by default, until toggled.
\item If file fits on one screen, there is no scrollbar and ON{}-F3 has
no effect.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Settings are not remembered after the viewer has been exited.

\item Does not currently support right{}-to{}-left languages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{VBRfix}
This function scans a VBR (Variable Bitrate)
MP3 file and updates/creates the Xing VBR header. The Xing header
contains information about the VBR stream used to calculate average bit
rate, time information and to more accurately fwd/rew in the stream.

This function is especially useful when the playback of a file skips,
fwd/rew does not work correctly or the time display is incorrect. Run
VBRfix on files you record with your Jukebox. The header is not present
in the recorded files and VBRfix adds this header.

Note: VBRfix can only run when music is
turned off (since it uses the same memory as the player) and can take a
while to complete if run on big files.

 \newline
  Recorder battery test  Player battery test  
\par}

This plugin simulates normal power drain by spinning up the disk and
reading a big file once every 90 seconds (or thereabouts). Each
spin up also writes the battery level to a
log file. The test stops when battery level reaches 4\% in order to
avoid being unable to write to the disk.  The power usage data is saved
to a file in the root directory of the Jukebox.  This plugin can
sometimes be useful for diagnosing problems with battery charging.

\subsubsection{Backlight configuration}
If RIGHT or LEFT is not pressed during clock operation (with the
exception of at the Help/Options/Mode Selector/Credit screens) then the
backlight timeout will remain your Rockbox default setting (example, 15
seconds). If RIGHT or LEFT is pressed, Clock will set the backlight to
ON or OFF, respectively. When Clock is exited, your default Rockbox
setting for Backlight will be restored. 

\subsubsection{Saving Settings}
Settings are saved to disk when Clock is exited. They are saved to
\textbf{/.rockbox/rocks/.clock\_settings''}. To reset your settings
back to the defaults, simply navigate to this file using Rockbox,
highlight it, and press the ON+PLAY keys to get the Delete option. This way you can feel free to experiment with the settings {}- and you could even load
separate settings, say, one for your desk at home and one for in the car {}- by keeping two files in your \textbf{/.rockbox/rocks} folder such as
``h.clock\_settings'' and ``c.clock\_settings''. Simply remove the
``h'' for your home settings to go into effect, or add the ``h'' back and take off the ``c'' for your car settings.

In the future, loading different settings will probably be made easier
through a built{}-in settings file loader in Clock.

\subsection{Split Editor (Recorder, Ondio)}
When recording an mp3 file, it is common practice to start the recording
a little bit early and stop it a little bit late to ensure all the
desired sound is recorded. This results in recordings that contain
extra snippets of sound and the beginning and end. Unfortunately these
snippets can not be deleted easily because they are stored in the same
file as the desired recording. The purpose of the split editor is to
split a mp3 file (the input file) at a point in time (split point). Two
new files can be generated from the input file. The first file contains
the part before the split point and the second file contains the part
after the split point. Once this process has been successful the
original file can be deleted or kept as a backup. 

The whole process of splitting a mp3 file consists of three steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item defining the split point 
\item generating the result files. 
\item if desired delete the input file (with the browser, not the split
editor) 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{How to use the Split Editor}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pause near the split point}
When the device plays the song just hit the PAUSE button, when playback
has roughly reached the split point. This need not be very precise as
the split point can be fine tuned later.
\item \textbf{Open the split editor}

Open the plugin.  A screen similar to the one below will appear. 

{\centering\itshape

 \newline
The Split Editor
\par}

{\centering\upshape
Here is an explanation of the areas marked in red on the screenshot.
\par}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The waveform \newline
\newline
The waveform displays the volume of the song over time. It will appear
as the song plays and help to visually identify the point in time where
the split is desired
\item The split point indicator\newline
\newline
The split point indicator is a vertical line with a small triangle at
the top end. It is the most important control element of the split
editor. It can be moved with the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. Later, when
you have fine tuned the split point, the song will be split at this
position.
\item The split time\newline
\newline
At the top of the window a time value is displayed. This is the point in
time within the song at which the split point indicator is positioned. 
\item The locator\newline
\newline
Another vertical bar represents the position locator. It moves along as
the song plays. In contrast to the split point indicator it has no
triangles at the ends. 
\item The time bar\newline
\newline
The time bar displays the current position within the song relative to
the whole song. The entire length of the time bar represents the song
length. The length of the solid part of the time bar represents the position and length
of the displayed part of the song.
\item The scale mode\newline
\newline
Directly above the F3 button the scale mode is displayed. The waveform
can be scaled either logarithmically or linearly. In logarithmic scale
mode the letters ``dB'' are displayed, in linear mode ``\%''. Use F3 to
switch between these modes. Linear mode usually gives better optical
hints with commercially recorded music. For quiet recordings,
especially of human speech, the logarithmic scale often is preferable.
\item The loop mode \newline
\newline
Directly above the F2 button the loop mode icon is displayed. There are
4 different loop modes. Pressing F2 changes to the next loop mode. 

\begin{itemize}
\item   [Warning: Image ignored] % Unhandled or unsupported graphics:
%\includegraphics[width=0.794cm,height=0.476cm]{images/rockbox-manual-img68.gif}

\subsubsection{Save the files}
In the save dialogue it is possible to specify which of the files you
want to save and their names.  When finished, select
``Save'' and the files will be written to
disk. Note that files can not be overwritten, so filenames that
don't exist yet must be chosen. If unsure whether the
file already exists simply try to save it. If another file with this
name exists the dialogue will return and you can choose another
filename

\subsubsection{Scale}
The values in the waveform are scaled according to the settings of the
peak meter. These can be altered in the menu
\textbf{General Settings {}-{\textgreater} Display{}-{\textgreater} Peak Meter}. If extreme minimum /
maximum values are set the waveform might be cut off.  A minimum
setting of {}-60 dB and a maximum setting of 0 dB are recommended.
These settings should be capable of producing useful waveforms for very
soft sounds in logarithmic mode (dB). When the editor is used on loud
sounds (such as commercial rock or pop music) switching to the linear
scale may prove more effective since the logarithmic scale compresses
loud noises and makes it more difficult to identify characteristic
shapes. Note that it is always possible to toggle the scale with F3.
