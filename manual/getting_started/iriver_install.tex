\section{Preparing for Rockbox}
There are two separate components of Rockbox that need to be installed in order to run Rockbox.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Rockbox bootloader. This is the component of Rockbox that is installed to the flash memory of your \playerman. The bootloader is the program that tells your \dap\ how to boot and load other components of Rockbox.
\item The Rockbox firmware. Unlike the \playerman\ firmware, which runs entirely from flash memory, most of the Rockbox code is contained in the build that resides on your jukebox's hard drive. This makes it easy to update Rockbox. The build contain a file named \firmwarefilename\ and a directory called \fname{.rockbox} which are located in the root directory of your  hard drive.
\end{enumerate}
