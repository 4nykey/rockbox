\section{Introduction}

Rockbox allows you to put the album art, or another image related to the music
on your \dap{} to display it in the PictureFlow plugin\opt{albumart}{ or in the
WPS}. For this feature to work, you must observe a few rules.

\section{Limitations}

Rockbox does not support album art embedded in your files' tags, and will
instead look for a picture located in the filesystem. In addition to this, the
pictures must be in the BMP or JPEG formats. Rockbox does not support
RLE-compressed BMP files, nor does it support progressive and multi-scan
JPEG files. JPEG files must consist of a single scan with interleaved components, 
as progessive and multi-scan images require much more memory to decode.

\section{Where to put album art}

The pictures can be named a number of different ways, and placed to a number of
different locations. You can have pictures specific to the file or the album
or use a generic picture. You can place the picture in the same directory
as the file, in the parent directory or in a fixed directory named
\fname{/.rockbox/albumart/}. The order Rockbox uses when looking for a picture
is as follows (a list in braces means that those file extensions are tried in
that order):

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \fname{./filename.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./cover.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{./folder.jpg}
\item  \fname{/.rockbox/albumart/artist-albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{../albumtitle.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\item  \fname{../cover.\{jpeg,jpg,bmp\}}
\end{enumerate}

The following characters will be replaced with an underscore (\_) when looking
for albumtitle.bmp or artist-albumtitle.bmp: \textbackslash{} / : \textless{}
\textgreater{} ? * \textbar{}. Doublequotes will be replaced by single quotes.
See \wikilink{AlbumArt} in the wiki for more details and programs that will
help you automate the process of putting album art on your \dap{}.
