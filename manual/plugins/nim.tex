Rules of Nim: There are 21 matches. Two players (you and the Jukebox)
alternately pick a certain number of matches and the one who takes the
last match loses.  You can take up to twice as many matches as the
Jukebox selected, and vice versa. 

\begin{table}
\begin{btnmap}{}{}
\ButtonLeft  & Decrease the number of matches \\
\ButtonRight & Increase the number of matches \\
\ButtonPlay   & Remove the number of matches you have selected \\
\ButtonStop  & Exit the game \\
\end{btnmap}
\end{table}
