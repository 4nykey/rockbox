This folder contains the java parts needed to build an Rockbox as an
application for android.

* Prerequisites

Download and install the Android SDK[1] and NDK[2].
After you extracted the SDK, you need to run <sdk-dir>/tools/android in order to
install the actual platform sdk from the available packages tab (SDK Platform
Android 1.5 or above should work).
In the virtual devices tab you can also setup a emulator.


Then, make sure you have the ANDROID_SDK_PATH and ANDROID_NDK_PATH (pointing to
the each's root directory) environment variables set up, otherwise configure will fail to find the compiler and
compiling the java files will fail.

* Build instructions

Use this as your build folder, using '../tools/configure' etc.
    $ ../tools/configure # type 200, then chose A for android and your screen resolution
    $ make

After the build finished, you can create a Rockbox.apk in bin/
    $ make apk

You can install that on the device
    $ $ANDROID_SDK_PATH/tools/adb install -r bin/Rockbox.apk


NOTE: make apk needs creates a debug signed .apk, not suitable for distribution.
It expects that this key already exists.
You should be able to generate it with "keytool" using the following options:
* Keystore name: "debug.keystore"
* Keystore password: "android"
* Key alias: "androiddebugkey"
* Key password: "android"
* CN: "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
* validity: 365 days

Google docs mention the SDK tools can generate it as well, but I haven't found how yet.
