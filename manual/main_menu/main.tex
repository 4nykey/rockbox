\section{Introducing the Main Menu}
\screenshot{main_menu/images/ss-main-menu}{The main menu}{}
The \setting{Main Menu} is the screen from which the rest of the Rockbox functions can be 
accessed. It is used for a variety of functions, which are detailed below. 
All options in Rockbox can be controlled via the \setting{Main Menu}.
To enter the \setting{Main Menu}, 
  \opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD,IRIVER_H300_PAD}{press the \ButtonMode\ button.}%
  \opt{RECORDER_PAD}{press the \ButtonFOne\ button.}%
  \opt{PLAYER_PAD,IPOD_4G_PAD,IPOD_3G_PAD}{press the \ButtonMenu\
    button.}%
  \opt{ONDIO_PAD}{hold the \ButtonMenu{} button.}%
  \opt{IAUDIO_X5_PAD}{press the \ButtonRec\ button.}%
  \opt{IRIVER_H10_PAD}{press the \ButtonPower\ button.}%

All settings are stored on the unit. However, Rockbox does not spin up 
the disk solely for the purpose of saving settings.  Instead, Rockbox will
save settings when it spins up the disk the next time, for example when 
refilling the MP3 buffer or navigating through the file browser. Changes to 
settings may therefore not be saved unless the \dap\ is shut down safely 
(see \reference{ref:Safeshutdown}).

\section {Recent Bookmarks}
\screenshot{main_menu/images/ss-list-bookmarks}%
  {The list bookmarks screen}{}
If the \setting{Save a list of recently created bookmarks} option is enabled 
then you can view a list of several recent bookmarks here and select one to 
jump straight to that track. See \reference{ref:Bookmarkconfigactual} 
for more details on configuring bookmarking in Rockbox.
\note{This option is off by default.}

\section{Sound Settings}
The \setting{Sound Settings} menu offers a selection of sound properties you may 
change to customise your listening experience.  The details of this menu are 
covered in detail in \reference{ref:configure_rockbox_sound}. 

\section{General Settings}
The \setting{General Settings} menu allows you to customise the way Rockbox looks 
and the way it plays music.  The details of this menu are covered in detail in 
\reference{ref:configure_rockbox_general}.

\section{Manage Settings}
The \setting{Manage Settings} option allows the saving and re-loading of user 
configuration settings, browsing the hard drive for alternate firmwares, and finally
resetting your \dap{} back to initial configuration.
%
\opt{MASCODEC}{This menu also allows the user to load different versions of the 
Rockbox firmware.} 
%
The details of this menu are covered in detail in 
\reference{ref:manage_settings}.

\section{Browse Themes}
This option will display all the currently installed themes on the \dap, 
press \ButtonRight\ to load the chosen theme and apply it.

A theme is basically a configuration file, stored in a specific directory, 
that typically changes the WPS 
\opt{h1xx,h300,x5}{and remote WPS}, font used and on some platforms
additional information such as background image and text colours.

There are a number of themes that ship with Rockbox. If none of
these suit your needs, many more can be downloaded from 
\opt{RECORDER_PAD}{\wikilink{WpsArchos}}%
\opt{h1xx}{\wikilink{WpsIriverH100}}%
\opt{h300,ipodcolor}{\wikilink{WpsIriverH300}}%
\opt{ipodvideo}{\wikilink{WpsIpod5g}}%
\opt{ipodnano}{\wikilink{WpsIpodNano}}%
\opt{ipodmini}{\wikilink{WpsIpodMini}}%
\opt{x5}{\wikilink{WpsIaudioX5}}%
.
Some of the downloads from this site will actually be standalone WPS files, 
others will be full-blown themes. 

\note{Themes do not have to be purely visual.  It is quite possible to create
a theme that switches between audio configurations for use in the car, with
headphones and when connected to an external amplifier.  See 
\reference{ref:CreateYourOwnWPS} for more details.

\section{\label{ref:playlistoptions}Playlist Options}
  This menu allows you to work with playlists. Playlists can be created in 
  three ways. Playing a file in a directory causes all the files in the 
  directory to be placed in a playlist. Playlists can be created manually by
  either using the  \setting{File Menu} (see \reference{ref:Filemenu}) or using
  the \setting{Playlist Options} menu.  Both automatically and manually created
  playlists can be edited using this menu.

\begin{description}
\item[Create Playlist:]
  Rockbox will create a playlist with all tracks in the current directory 
and all sub-directories. The playlist will be created one folder level ``up'' 
from where you currently are.
  
\item[View Current Playlist:]
  Displays the contents of the playlist currently stored in memory.
  
\item[Save Current Playlist:]
  Saves the current dynamic playlist, excluding queued tracks, to the 
specified file. If no path is provided then playlist is saved to current 
directory (see \reference{ref:Playlistsubmenu}).
  
\item[Recursively Insert Directories: ]
  If set to \setting{On}, then when a directory is inserted or queued into a 
  dynamic playlist, all sub-directories will also be inserted. If set to \setting{Ask},
  Rockbox will prompt the user about whether to include sub-directories.
  Options: \setting{Off}, \setting{Ask}, \setting{On}

\item[Warn When Erasing Dynamic Playlist: ]
  If set to \setting{Yes}, Rockbox will provide a warning if the user attempts to
  take an action that will cause Rockbox to erase the current dynamic playlist.
  Options: \setting{Yes}, \setting{No}
\end{description}

\section{Browse Plugins}
  With this option you can load and run various plugins that have been
written for Rockbox. There are a wide variety of these supplied with
Rockbox, including several games, some impressive demos and a number of
utilities. A detailed description of the different plugins is to be found in 
\reference{ref:plugins}.

\section{\label{ref:Info}Info}
  This option shows RAM buffer size, battery voltage level and estimated time
remaining, disk total space and disk free space.
\opt{player}{Use the MINUS and PLUS keys to step through several 
pages of information.}

\begin{description}
\item[Rockbox Info:]
  Displays some basic system information. This is, from top to bottom,
  the amount of memory Rockbox has available for storing music (the buffer).
  The battery status.
\opt{ondio}{%
  Memory size and amount of free space on the two data volumes, this info is
  given seperately for internal memory (\emph{Int}) and for a plugged in MMC
(\emph{MMC}).
}%
\nopt{ondio}{Hard disk size and the amount of free space on the disk.}

\item[Version:]
  Software version and credits display.
  
\item[Debug (Keep Out!):]
  This sub menu is intended to be used \emph{only} by Rockbox developers.
  It shows hardware, disk, battery status and other technical information.  
  \warn{It is not recommended that users access this menu unless instructed to
  do so in the course of fixing a problem with Rockbox. If you think you have 
  messed up your settings by use of this menu please try to reset \emph{all} 
  settings before asking for help.}
\end{description}

\opt{player}{
  \section{Shutdown}
  This menu option saves the Rockbox configuration and turns off the hard
  drive before shutting down the machine. For maximum safety this procedure
  is recommended when turning off the \dap. (There is a very small risk
  of hard disk corruption otherwise.) See \reference{ref:Safeshutdown}
  for more details.

\nopt{PLAYER_PAD,ONDIO_PAD}

\section{Quick Menu}
  Whilst not strictly part of the \setting{Main Menu}, it is worth noting that
  a few of the more commonly used settings are available from the
  \setting{Quick Menu}.
  The \setting{Quick Menu} screen is accessed with \ActionStdQuickScreen
  and exited with the same button.
  It allows rapid access to the \setting{Shuffle} and \setting{Repeat}
  modes (\reference{ref:PlaybackOptions}) and the \setting{Show Files}
  option (\reference{ref:ShowFiles}).
