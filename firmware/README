Build your own archos.mod.

1. Check out 'firmware' and 'apps' from CVS (or possibly form a downloaded
   archive). You probably want to check out 'tools' too (to get the configure
   script if nothing else) and possibly the 'uisimulator' too (for trying out
   things on host before making target tests).

2. Create your own build directory. This is where all generated files will be
   put.

3. In your build directory, run the 'tools/configure' script and enter what
   target you want to build for and if you want a debug version or not. It'll
   prompt you. The debug version is for making a gdb version out of it. It is
   only useful if you run gdb towards your target Archos.

4. *ploink*. Now you have got a Makefile generated for you. Run 'make' and
   soon the necessary pieces from the firmware and the apps directories have
   been compiled and linked.

5. Copy the archos.mod file to your archos, reboot it and *smile*.

Whenever the tools/configure script gets updated, you can make your makefile
updated too by running 'tools/configure update'

If you want to build for more than one target, just create a new build
directory and create a setup for another target combination in there.
