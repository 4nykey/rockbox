PictureFlow is a plugin that provides a visualisation of your albums with
their associated cover art.

\subsubsection{Requirements}
PictureFlow uses both the album art (see \reference{ref:album_art}) and 
database (see \reference{ref:database}) features of Rockbox.
It is therefore important that these are working correctly before attempting
to use PictureFlow. In addition, there are some other points of which to be
aware:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item PictureFlow will accept album art larger than the dimensions of the
    screen, but the larger the dimensions, the longer they will take to scale.
    \item The main playback buffer is used which means that unless the size of the
    playing tracks is small you will have to stop playback to use PictureFlow.
  \end{itemize}

\note{PictureFlow is a visualisation only. It cannot be used to select and
play music.}

\subsubsection{Settings Menu}

\begin{description}
  \item[Show FPS.] Displays frames per second on screen.
  \item[Spacing.] The distance between the front edges of the side slides, i.e. changes
  the degree of overlap of the side slides. A larger number means less overlap. Scales with zoom.
  \item[Centre margin.] The distance, in screen pixels, with zoom at 100, between
  the centre and side slides. Scales with zoom.
  \item[Number of slides.] Sets the number of slides at each side, including the
  centre slide. Therefore if set to 4, there will be 3 slides on the left,
  the centre slide, and then 3 slides on the right.
  \item[Zoom.] Changes the distance at which slides are rendered from the "camera".
  \item[Show album title.] Allows setting the album title to be shown above or
  below the cover art, or not at all.
  \item[Resize Covers.] Set whether to automatically resize the covers or to leave
  them at their original size.
  \item[Rebuild cache.] Rebuild the PictureFlow cache. This is needed in order
  for PictureFlow to pick up new albums, and may occasionally be needed if albums
  are removed.
