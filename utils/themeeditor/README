To build the theme editor, you will need a Qt development environment with the
Qt core and GUI libraries and qmake, along with standard C and C++ compilers
and libraries.  To compile, cd to the source directory and run the "qmake"
command followed by "make".  This will produce the binary "themeeditor".  At the
moment, this simply prints a text debug tree.  Soon, it will launch a GUI
application.
