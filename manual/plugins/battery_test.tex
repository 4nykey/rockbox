This plugin simulates normal power drain by spinning up the disk and
reading a big file once every 90 seconds (or thereabouts). Each
spin up also writes the battery level to a
log file. The test stops when battery level reaches 4\% in order to
avoid being unable to write to the disk.  The power usage data is saved
to a file in the root directory of the Jukebox.  This plugin can
sometimes be useful for diagnosing problems with battery charging.
