Custom CFG
File Format Specifications

Description / General Info
--------------------------
* The .cfg file is used on both the Rockbox Player and Recorder, in order to
  load custom settings.
* Currently, only sound settings are supported but this will change in the
  future.

File Location
-------------
The files may reside anywhere on the hard disk. The only restriction is that
the filename must end in .cfg

Format Rules
------------
* Each setting must have it's own line.
* Lines starting with # are ignored.
* If a value is out of the acceptable range for the device, which can vary 
  depending on the model, the value will be set to its default value.
