This directory is meant to contain sources that can be compiled and run in any
of the simulators. The code should also either run on target, or be very
similar to code that would run on target.

Simulator-specific code should not be store here, but in the specific
directories for the simulators.

For further information see ../docs/UISIMULATOR
