{Snake 2 {--} The Snake Strikes Back}{img:snake2}

Another version of the Snake game. Move the snake around, and eat the
apples that pop up on the screen. Each time an apple is eaten, the
snake gets longer. The game ends when the snake hits a wall, or runs
into itself. 

The controls are:

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}\toprule
\textbf{Key} & \textbf{Action} \\\midrule
UP/DOWN & (in menu) Set game speed \\
F1 & (in menu) Change starting maze \\
F3 & (in menu) Select game type (A or B) \\
UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT & Steer the snake \\
PLAY & Pause the game \\
STOP & Exit the game \\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
In game A, the maze stays the same, in Game B
after an increasing number of apples eaten the maze is replaced by a
new one.
