Throughout this manual, the buttons on the \dap{} are labelled according to the
picture above. In detail the buttons are described in the following paragraph.

\blind{
  %
  \opt{h1xx}{ 
  If you lay the \dap{} on the table with the joystick pointing 
  towards you, and the curved sides at the top, you will find the following 
  if you start from the top-right corner and follow the side of the \dap{} in a
  clockwise direction:
  On the right side the buttons \ButtonOn{}, \ButtonOff{}, \ButtonMode{} and
  the hold switch. Next comes on the bottom the USB port,
  a small hole for resetting the \dap{}, charger plug. On the left side located
  is the button \ButtonRec{}. At least the top has headphone minijack plug,
  remote port, optical/line in and optical/line out.
  The joystick in the middle of the \dap{} is 
  used to navigate menus by pressing it up, down, left and right. Pressing the 
  joystick down is labelled \ButtonSelect{} throughout this manual. Its
  directions are labelled \ButtonRight{}, \ButtonDown{}, \ButtonLeft{} and
  \ButtonUp{}.}
  % 
  \opt{h300}{
  Hold the lay the \dap{} so that the side with the button pad and 
  LCD is facing towards you.  The buttons on the button pad are as follows:  top 
  left corner: \ButtonOn{}, bottom left corner: \ButtonOff{}, top right corner: 
  \ButtonRec, bottom right corner: \ButtonMode{}.  In the center of the button pad 
  is a button labelled \ButtonSelect{}.  Surrounding the \ButtonSelect{} button are 
  four directional buttons used to navigate up, down, left and right.
  
  On the top panel of the \dap{}, from left to right, you can find the 
  following: headphone minijack plug, remote port, Line-in, Line-out. 
  
  On the bottom panel of the \dap{}, from left to right, you can find the 
  following:  power jack and two USB ports.  The USB port on the right is used 
  to connect your \dap{} to your computer.  The USB port on the left is not 
  used in Rockbox. 
  }
  %
  \opt{ipod4g, ipod3g,ipodcolor,ipodvideo,ipodmini}
  { 
  The main controls on the \dap{} are a slightly indented scroll wheel 
  with a flat round button in the center. Hold the \dap{} with these controls 
  facing you. 

  The top of the player will have the following, from left to 
  right:
  \opt{ipod4g, ipod3g ,ipodcolor}{remote connector, headphone jack, hold 
    switch.}
  \opt{ipodvideo}{hold switch, headphone jack.}
  \opt{ipodmini}{hold switch, remote connector, headphone jack.}	

  The dock connector that is used to connect your \dap{} to your computer is on 
  the bottom panel of the \dap{}.

  The button in the middle of the wheel is called \ButtonSelect{}. You can
  operate the wheel by pressing the top, bottom, left or right sections,
  or by sliding your finger around it.  The top is \ButtonMenu{}, the bottom is
  \ButtonPlay{}, the left is \ButtonLeft{}, and the right is \ButtonRight{}.
  When the manual says to \ButtonScrollFwd{}, it means to slide your finger
  clockwise around the wheel. \ButtonScrollBack{} means to slide your finger
  counterclockwise. Note that the wheel is sensitive, so you will need to move
  slowly at first and get a feel for how it works.
  
  Note that when the hold switch is pushed toward the center of the \dap{}, 
  ``hold'' is on, and none of the other controls do anything.  Be sure ``hold'' 
  is off before trying to use your player.

\subsection{Turning the \dap{} on and off}
To turn on your Rockbox enabled \dap{} use the following keys:
\begin{table}
    \begin{btnmap}{}{}
      \opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD,IRIVER_H300_PAD}{\ButtonOn}
      \opt{IPOD_4G_PAD,IPOD_3G_PAD}{\ButtonMenu\ or \ButtonSelect}
      \opt{ONDIO_PAD}{\ButtonOff}\opt{RECORDER_PAD,PLAYER_PAD}
        {Hold \ButtonOn\ for 2{}-3s}
      \opt{IAUDIO_X5_PAD}{\ButtonPower} 
      & Start Rockbox\\
      \opt{IRIVER_H100_PAD,IRIVER_H300_PAD}{Hold \ButtonOff}
      \opt{IPOD_4G_PAD,IPOD_3G_PAD}{Hold \ButtonPlay}
      \opt{ONDIO_PAD,recorderv2fm}{Hold \ButtonOff}
      \opt{recorder}{Double tap \ButtonOff\ when playback is stopped}
      \opt{PLAYER_PAD}{From the Main Menu, select \textbf{Shutdown}}
      \opt{IAUDIO_X5_PAD}{Hold \ButtonPower}
      & Shutdown Rockbox\\
    \end{btnmap}
\end{table}

\label{ref:Safeshutdown}On shutdown, Rockbox automatically saves its settings.
\opt{PLAYER_PAD,RECORDER_PAD,ONDIO_PAD}{%
  In the unlikely event of a software failure, a hardware power off can be
  performed by holding down
  \opt{PLAYER_PAD}{\ButtonStop}%
  \opt{RECORDER_PAD,ONDIO_PAD}{\ButtonOff}
  until the \nopt{ondiosp,ondiofm}{\dap{} power light}%
  \opt{ondiosp,ondiofm}{\daps{} display} goes off.%
}
\subsection{The first contact}

After you have  first started the \dap{} you'll be presented by the File
Browser. With the default settings only supported files are shown. Rockbox'
default view is the file browser, similar to Windows' Explorer. If you don't
have audio files on your \dap{}, or created folders you will only see a blank
screen with the statusbar at the top. If this is your case, now is a good time
to connect your \dap{} to a computer and transfer some audio files to it.

When you have files on your \dap{} you'll see the supported ones now. Of
course you can change this view later. You can also completely switch to
a view that is based on the metadata\footnote{ID3 Tags, Vorbis comments, etc.}
of your audio files. This view is called TagCache (see
\reference{ref:tagcache}). Now you can start browsing the folder structure of
your \dap{}.

\subsection{Basic controls}
When browsing files and moving through menus you usually get a list view
presented. The navigation in these lists are usually the same and should be
pretty intuitive.
In the tree view use \ActionStdNext{} and \ActionStdPrev{} to move around
the selection. Use \ActionStdOk{} to select an item. When browsing the file
system selecting an audio file plays it. The view switches to the ``While
playing screen'', usually abbreviated as ``WPS'' (see \reference{ref:WPS}. The
dynamic playlist gets replaced with the contents of the current folder. This
way you can easily treat folders as playlists. The created dynamic playlist can
be extended or modified while playing. This is also known as
``on-the-fly playlist''.
To go back to the file browser stop the playback with the \ActionWpsStop{}
button or return to the file browser while keeping playback running using
\ActionWpsBrowse{}.
In list views you can go back one step with \ActionStdCancel{}. The file
browser is a bit different in this case as pressing \ActionWpsStop{}
stops the playback instead of going up a level.

\subsection{Basic concepts}
\subsubsection{Main Screen}
Rockbox' main screen is the file browser. This is pretty different to most
other players that use the ``While Playing Screen'' as their main screen.
In Rockbox' view this doesn't make any sense as when you are not playing a
file, information about the currently playing file isn't available and therfore
useless. Because of this the \dap{} switches to the file browser when
playback gets stopped. There is no point showing the WPS when playback is
stopped, so this is not and will not be possible.

\subsubsection{Playlists}
Rockbox is playlist oriented. This means that every time you play an audio file,
a so-called ``dynamic playlist'' is generated,  unless you play a saved
playlist. You can modify the dynamic playlist while playing and also save
it to a file. If you don't want to use playlists you can simply play your
files folder based.
Playlists are covered in detail in \ref{ref:working_with_playlists}.

\subsubsection{Menu}
From the menu you can customise Rockbox. Rockbox itself is very customisable.
Also there are some special menus for quick access to frequently used
functions.

\subsubsection{Context Menu}
Some views, especially the file browser and the WPS have a context menu.
From the file browser this can be accessed with \ActionStdContext{}.
The contents of the context menu vary, depending on the situation it gets
called. The context menu itself presents you with some operations you can
perform with the currently hightlighted file. In the file browser this is
the file (or folder) that is highlighted by the cursor. From the WPS this is
the currently playing file. Also there are some actions that don't apply
to the current file but refer to the screen from which the context menu
gets called. One example is the playback menu, which can be called using
the context menu from within the WPS.

\section{Customizing Rockbox}
Rockbox' User Interface can be customized using ``Themes''. Themes usually
only affect the visual apperance, but an advanced user can create a theme
that also changes various other settings like file view, LCD settings and
all other settings that can be modified using \fname{.cfg} files. This topic
is discussed in more detail in \reference{ref:manage_settings}.
The Rockbox distribution comes with some themes that should look nice on
your \dap{}. \note{Some of the themes shipped with Rockbox need additional
fonts from the fonts package, so make sure you installed them.
Also, if you downloaded additional themes from the internet make sure you
have the needed fonts installed as otherwise the theme may get displayed
garbled.}
