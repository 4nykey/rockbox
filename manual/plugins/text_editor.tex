\subsection{Text Editor}
This plugin allows you to view and edit simple text documents on your DAP.
You can view files by using \textbf{Open with} from the
\textbf{File Menu} (see \rockref{ref:Filemenu}).

\subsubsection{Usage}
If you start the Text Editor from the plugin browser you will be greeted with
a blank screen. When started from the \textbf{Open with} menu item your file 
should be shown on the screen. You can now edit the file.
The Text Editor is line base. This means you can edit one line at a time using
the virtual keyboard.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Move the selection bar to the line you want to edit.
  \item Edit the highlighted text line or insert a new one using the Item Menu.
  \item When finished editing exit the Text Editor. You'll be shown a list of
        save options. 
\end{itemize}
\note{When you haven't changed the file the Text Editor will quit immediately.}
